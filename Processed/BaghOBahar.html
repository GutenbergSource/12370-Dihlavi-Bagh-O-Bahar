<p class="first">The <i>B&#257;g&#863;h O Bah&#257;r</i>, or
&ldquo;Garden and Spring,&rdquo; has, for the last half century, been
held as a classical work throughout our Indian empire. It highly
deserves this distinguished fate, as it contains various modes of
expression in correct language; and displays a great variety of Eastern
manners and modes of thinking. It is an excellent introduction not only
to the colloquial style of the <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n&#299;</i>
language, but also to a knowledge of its various idioms and popular
phrases.</p>
<p>The tale itself is interesting, if we bear in mind the fact, that no
Asiatic writer of romance or history has ever been consistent, or free
from fabulous credulity. The cautious march of undeviating truth, and a
careful regard to <i>vraisemblance</i>, have never entered into their
plan. Wildness of imagination, fabulous machinery, and unnatural scenes
ever pervade the compositions of Oriental authors,&mdash;even in most
serious works on history and ethics. Be it remembered, that
<i>jinns</i>, demons, fairies, and angels, form a part of the
<i>Muh&#803;ammadan</i> creed. The people to this day believe in the
existence of such beings on the faith of the <i>&#7730;ur,&#257;n</i>;
and as they are fully as much attached to their own religion as we are
to ours, we ought not to be surprised at their credulity. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e150" href="#xd26e150" name=
"xd26e150">4</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have rendered the translation as literal as possible, consistent
with the comprehension of the author&rsquo;s meaning. This may be
considered by some a slavish and dull compliance; but in my humble
opinion we ought, in this case, to display the author&rsquo;s own
thoughts and ideas; all we are permitted to do, is to change their
garb. This course has one superior advantage which may compensate for
its seeming dulness; we acquire an insight into the modes of thinking
and action of the people, whose works we peruse through the medium of a
literal translation, and thence many instructive and interesting
conclusions may be drawn.</p>
<p>To the present edition numerous notes are appended; some, with a
view to illustrate certain peculiarities of the author&rsquo;s style,
and such grammatical forms of the language as might appear difficult to
a beginner; others, which mainly relate to the manners and customs of
the people of the East, may appear superfluous to the Oriental scholar
who has been in India; but in this case, I think it better to be
redundant, than risk the chance of being deficient. Moreover, as the
book may be perused by the curious in Europe, many of of whom know
nothing of India, except that it occupies a certain space in the map of
the world, these notes were absolutely necessary to understand the
work. Finally, as I am no poet, and have a most thorough contempt for
the maker of mere doggerel rhymes, I have translated the pieces of
poetry, which are interspersed in the original, into plain and humble
prose.</p>

<p>The pure God! what an [excellent] Artificer he is! He who, out of a
handful of dust, hath created such a variety of faces and figures of
earth. Notwithstanding the two colours [of men], one white and one
black, yet the same nose and ears, the same hands and feet, He has
given to all. But such variety of features has He formed, that the form
and shape of one [individual] does not agree with the personal
appearance of another. Among millions of created beings, you may
recognise whomsoever you wish. The sky is a bubble in the ocean of his
[eternal] unity; and the earth is as a drop of water in it; but this is
wonderful, that the sea beats its thousands of billows against it, and
yet cannot do it any injury. The tongue of man is impotent to sound the
praise and eulogy of Him who has such power and might! If it utter any
thing, what can it say? It is best to be silent on a subject concerning
which nothing can be said.</p>

all the excellent qualities that great men ought to possess. In short,
it was the good fortune of this country that such a chief came here,

India, and transact with perfect accuracy the affairs of the country;
for this reason many books were compiled during this same year,
according to orders.</p>
<p>To those gentlemen who are learned, and speak the language of

"#xd26e489" name="xd26e489src">7</a> I address myself, and say, that
this &ldquo;Tale of the Four Darwesh&rdquo; was originally composed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e492" href="#xd26e492" name=

"noteref" id="xd26e523src" href="#xd26e523" name="xd26e523src">10</a>
who was his spiritual preceptor, (and whose holy residence was near
<i>Dill&#299;</i>, three <i>Kos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e542src"
href="#xd26e542" name="xd26e542src">11</a> from the fort, beyond the
red gate, and outside the <i>Ma&#7789;iy&#257;</i> gate, near the red
house), fell ill; and to amuse his preceptor&rsquo;s mind, <i>Am&#299;r
K&#863;husr&#363;</i> used to repeat this tale to him, and attend him
during his sickness. God, in the course of time, removed his illness;
then he pronounced this benediction on the day he performed the
ablution of cure:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e555src" href="#xd26e555"
name="xd26e555src">12</a> &ldquo;That whoever will hear this tale,
will, with the blessing of God, remain in health:&rdquo; since which
time this tale, composed in Persian, has been extensively read.</p>
<p>Now, the excellent and liberal gentleman, the judge of respectable
men, Mr. John Gilchrist, (may his good fortune ever increase as long as
the <i>Jamuna</i> and <i>Ganges</i> flow!) with kindness said to me,
&ldquo;Translate this tale into the pure
<i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n&#299;</i> tongue, which the <i>Urd&#363;</i>
people, both <i>Hind&#363;s</i> and <i>Musalm&#257;ns</i>, high and

other.&rdquo; In accordance with his honour&rsquo;s desire, I commenced
translating it into this same dialect, just such as any one uses in
common conversation.</p>
<p>But first this guilty being, <i>M&#299;r Amman</i>, of
<i>Dill&#299;</i>, begs to relate his own story: &ldquo;That my
forefathers, from the time of King <i>Hum&#257;y&#363;n</i>, served
every king, in regular descent, with zeal and fidelity; and
they<a class="noteref" id="xd26e596src" href="#xd26e596" name=
"xd26e596src">13</a> also (i.e. the kings), with the eye of protection,
ever justly appreciated and rewarded our services.
<i>J&#257;g&#299;rs</i>, titles and rewards, were plentifully bestowed
on us; and we were called hereditary<a class="noteref" id="xd26e622src"
href="#xd26e622" name="xd26e622src">14</a> vassals, and old servants;
so that these epithets were enrolled in the royal archives.<a class=

When such a family (owing to which all other families were prosperous)
dwindled to such a point! which is too well<a class="noteref" id=

home. Having sustained such various misfortunes, I abandoned that city,
which was my native land, and the place of my birth. Such a vessel,
whose pilot was such a king, was wrecked; and I began to sink in the
sea of destitution! a drowning person catches at a straw, and I
sustained life for some years in the city of
<i>&rsquo;Az&#804;&#299;m-&#257;b&#257;d</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e715src" href="#xd26e715" name="xd26e715src">19</a> experiencing
both good and bad fortune there. At length I left it also&mdash;the
times were not propitious; leaving my family there, I embarked alone in
a boat, and came in quest of a livelihood<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e751src" href="#xd26e751" name="xd26e751src">20</a> to Calcutta,
the chief of cities. I remained unemployed for some time, when it
happened that <i>Naww&#257;b Dil&#257;war Jang</i> sent for me, and
appointed me tutor to his younger brother, <i>M&#299;r Muh&#803;ammad
K&#257;z&#804;im K&#863;h&#257;n</i>. I stayed with him nearly two
years; but saw not my advantage [in remaining there any longer.] Then,
through the assistance of <i>M&#299;r Bah&#257;dur &rsquo;Al&#299;
Munsh&#299;</i>, I was introduced to Mr. John Gilchrist (may his
dignity be lasting.) At last, by the aid of good fortune, I have
acquired the protection of so liberal a person, that I hope better

I have bread to eat, and having stretched my feet, I repose in quiet;
and that ten persons in my family, old and young, are fed; and bless
that patron. May God accept [their prayers!]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The account of the <i>Urd&#363;</i> tongue I have thus heard
from my ancestors;&mdash;that the city of <i>Dill&#299;</i>, according
to the opinion of the <i>Hind&#363;s</i>, was founded in the earliest
times,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e776src" href="#xd26e776" name=
"xd26e776src">21</a> and that their <i>R&#257;j&#257;s</i> and subjects
lived there from the remotest antiquity, and spoke their own peculiar
<i>Bh&#257;kh&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e792src" href=
"#xd26e792" name="xd26e792src">22</a> For a thousand years past, the
<i>Musalm&#257;ns</i> have been masters there. <i>Mah&#803;m&#363;d</i>
of <i>G&#863;hazn&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e828src" href=
"#xd26e828" name="xd26e828src">23</a> came [there first]; then the

"xd26e858src" href="#xd26e858" name="xd26e858src">24</a> became kings;
owing to this intercourse, the languages of the <i>Hind&#363;s</i> and
<i>Musalm&#257;ns</i> were partially blended together. At last
<i>Am&#299;r Taim&#363;r</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e875src" href=
"#xd26e875" name="xd26e875src">25</a> (in whose family the name and
empire remain to this day), conquered <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i>. From
his coming and stay, the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> of his camp was settled
in the city; for which reason the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e893" href="#xd26e893" name=
"xd26e893">14</a>]</span><i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> of the city was called
<i>Urd&#363;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e900src" href="#xd26e900"
name="xd26e900src">26</a> Then King <i>Hum&#257;y&#363;n</i>, annoyed
by the <i>Pa&#7789;h&#257;ns</i>, went abroad [to Persia]; and at last,
returning from thence, he punished the surviving
[<i>Pa&#7789;h&#257;ns</i>], and no rebel remained to raise strife or
disturbance.</p>
<p>When King <i>Akbar</i> ascended the throne, then all tribes of
people, from all the surrounding countries, hearing of the goodness and
liberality of this unequalled family, flocked to his court, but the
speech and dialect of each was different. Yet, by being assembled
together, they used to traffic and do business, and converse with each
other, whence resulted the common <i>Urd&#363;</i> language. When his
majesty <i>Sh&#257;hjah&#257;n &#7778;&#257;h&#803;ib
&#7730;ir&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e932src" href=
"#xd26e932" name="xd26e932src">27</a> built the auspicious fort, and
the great mosque,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e975src" href="#xd26e975"
name="xd26e975src">28</a> and caused the walls of the city to be built;
and inlaid the peacock throne<a class="noteref" id="xd26e984src" href=
"#xd26e984" name="xd26e984src">29</a> with precious stones, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1000" href="#xd26e1000" name=

brocade; and <i>Naww&#257;b&rsquo; Al&#299; Mard&#257;n Kh&#257;n</i>
cut the canal<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1005src" href="#xd26e1005"
name="xd26e1005src">30</a> [to <i>Dill&#299;</i>]; then the king, being
pleased, made great rejoicings, and constituted the city his capital.
Since that time it has been called
<i>Sh&#257;jah&#257;n-&#257;b&#257;d</i>, (although the city of
<i>Dill&#299;</i> is distinct from it, the latter being called the old
city, and the former the new,) and to the bazar of it was given the
title of <i>Urd&#363;-e Mu&rsquo;all&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1027src" href="#xd26e1027" name="xd26e1027src">31</a></p>
<p>From the time of <i>Am&#299;r Taim&#363;r</i> until the reign of
<i>Muh&#803;ammad Sh&#257;h</i>, and even to the time of <i>Ah&#803;mad
Sh&#257;h</i>, and <i>&#256;lamg&#299;r</i> the Second, the throne
descended lineally from generation to generation. In the end, the
<i>Urd&#363;</i> language, receiving repeated polish, was so refined,
that the language of no city is to be compared to it; but an impartial
judge is necessary to examine it. Such a one God has at last, after a
long period, created in the learned, acute and profound Mr. John
Gilchrist, who from his own judgment, genius, labour and research, has
composed books of rules [for the acquisition of it]. From this cause,
the language of <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i> has become general
throughout the provinces, and has been polished anew; otherwise no one
conceives his own turban, language and behaviour, to be improper. If
you ask a countryman, he censures the citizen&rsquo;s idiom, and
considers his own the best; &ldquo;well, the learned only know [what is
correct].&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1051src" href="#xd26e1051"
name="xd26e1051src">32</a></p>
<p>When <i>Ah&#803;mad Sh&#257;h Abd&#257;l&#299;</i>, came from
<i>K&#257;bul</i> and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1062" href=

"xd26e1087src">34</a> the city became without a head. True it is, that
the city only flourished from the prosperity of the throne. All at once
it was overwhelmed with calamity: its principal inhabitants were
scattered, and fled wherever they could. To whatever country they went,
their own tongue was adulterated by mixing with the people there; and
there were many who, after an absence of ten to five years, from some
cause or other, returned to <i>Dill&#299;</i>, and stayed there. How
can they speak the pure language of <i>Dill&#299;</i>? somewhere or
other they will slip; but the person who bore all misfortunes, and
remained fixed at <i>Dill&#299;</i> and whose five or ten anterior
generations lived in that city, and who mixed in the company of the
great, and the assemblies and processions of the people, who strolled
in its streets for a length of time, and even after quitting it, kept
his language pure from corruption, his style of speaking will certainly
be correct. This humble being [viz. <i>M&#299;r Amman</i>], wandering
through many cities, and viewing their sights, has at last arrived at
this place. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1121" href="#xd26e1121"

some add a blessing on the twelve <i>Im&#257;ms</i>.&nbsp;<a class=

<i>F&#257;t&#804;ima</i>, who was married to her cousin-german
<i>&rsquo;Al&#299;,</i> who is considered as the first
<i>Im&#257;m</i>; the other eleven were the following, viz.,
<i>H&#803;asan</i>, the son of <i>&rsquo;Al&#299;; H&#803;usain</i>,
the son of <i>&rsquo;Al&#299;</i>; <i>&rsquo;Al&#299;</i>, surnamed
<i>Zainu-l-&rsquo;&#256;bid&#299;n,</i> son of <i>H&#803;usain;
Muhammad</i>, son of the last mentioned; <i>Ja&rsquo;far
S&#257;di&#7731;</i>, son of <i>Muh&#803;ammad;
M&#363;s&#257;-l-&#7730;&#257;z&#804;im,</i> son of <i>Ja&rsquo;far;
&rsquo;Al-i Raz&#803;&#257;</i>, son of <i>M&#363;s&#257;;

&rsquo;Al&#299; &rsquo;Askar&#299;</i>, son of <i>Muh&#803;ammad;
H&#803;asan &rsquo;Askar&#299;</i>: and lastly <i>Muh&#803;ammad
Mahd&#299;</i>. With regard to this last and twelfth <i>Im&#257;m</i>,
some say, very erroneously, that he is yet to appear. Now the fact is,
the twelfth <i>Im&#257;m</i> has appeared. He lived and died like the
rest of the sainthood; otherwise what would be the use of praying for
him? The Muhammadans offer up prayers for the dead, but I never heard
of their praying for the unborn.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

"noteref" id="xd26e1239src" href="#xd26e1239" name="xd26e1239src">9</a>
regulated periods of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1253" href=
"#xd26e1253" name="xd26e1253">19</a>]</span>prayer, he used to address
himself to his Creator and say, &ldquo;O God! thou hast, through thy
infinite goodness blest thy weak creature with every comfort, but thou
hast given no light to this dark abode.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1255src" href="#xd26e1255" name="xd26e1255src">10</a> This desire
alone is unaccomplished, that I have no one to transmit my name and
support my old age.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1264src" href=
"#xd26e1264" name="xd26e1264src">11</a> Thou hast everything in thy
hidden treasury; give me a living and thriving son, that my name and
the vestiges of this kingdom may remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this hope the king reached his fortieth year; when one day he had
finished his prayers in the Mirror Saloon,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1269src" href="#xd26e1269" name="xd26e1269src">12</a> and while
telling his beads, he happened to cast his eyes towards one of the
mirrors, and perceived a white hair in his whiskers, which glittered
like a silver wire; on seeing it, the king&rsquo;s eyes filled with
tears, and he heaved a deep sigh, and then said to himself,
&ldquo;Alas! thou hast wasted thy years to no purpose, and for earthly
advantages thou hast overturned the world. And all the countries thou
hast conquered, what advantage are they to thee? Some other race will
in the end squander these riches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1284" href="#xd26e1284" name="xd26e1284">20</a>]</span> Death
hath already sent thee a messenger;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1286src"
href="#xd26e1286" name="xd26e1286src">13</a> and even if thou livest a
few years, the strength of thy body will be less. Hence, it appears
clearly from this circumstance, that it is not my destiny to have an
heir to my canopy and throne. I must one day die, and leave everything
behind me; so it is better for me to quit them now, and dedicate the
rest of my days to the adoration of my Maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having in his heart made this resolve, he descended to his lower
garden.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1291src" href="#xd26e1291" name=
"xd26e1291src">14</a> Having dismissed his courtiers, he ordered that
no one should approach him in future, but that all should attend the
Public Hall of Audience,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1300src" href=
"#xd26e1300" name="xd26e1300src">15</a> and continue occupied in their
respective duties. After this speech the king retired to a private
apartment, spread the carpet of prayer,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1309src" href="#xd26e1309" name="xd26e1309src">16</a> and began
to occupy himself in devotion: he did nothing but weep and sigh. Thus
the king, <i>&#256;z&#363;d Bak&#863;hht</i> passed many days; in the
evening he broke his fast with a date and three mouthfuls of water, and
lay all day and night on the carpet of prayer. Those circumstances
became public, and by degrees the intelligence spread <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1330" href="#xd26e1330" name=
"xd26e1330">21</a>]</span>over the whole empire, that the king having
withdrawn his hand from public affairs, had become a recluse. In every
quarter enemies and rebels raised their heads, and stepped beyond the
bounds [of obedience]; whoever wished it, encroached on the kingdom,
and rebelled; wherever there were governors, in their jurisdictions
great disturbance took place; and complaints of mal-administration
arrived at court from every province. All the courtiers and nobles
assembled, and began to confer and consult.</p>
<p>At last it was agreed, &ldquo;that as his Highness the
<i>Waz&#299;r</i> is wise and intelligent, and in the king&rsquo;s
intimacy and confidence, and is first in dignity, we ought to go before
him, and hear what he thinks proper to say on the occasion,&rdquo; All
the nobles went to his Highness the <i>Waz&#299;r</i>, and said:
&ldquo;Such is the state of the king and such the condition of the
kingdom, that if more delay takes place, this empire, which has been
acquired with such trouble, will be lost for nothing, and will not be
easily regained.&rdquo; The <i>Waz&#299;r</i> was an old, faithful
servant, and wise; his name was <i>Khiradmand,</i> a name
self-significant.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1346src" href="#xd26e1346"
name="xd26e1346src">17</a> He replied, &ldquo;Though the king has
forbidden us to come into his presence, yet go you: I will also
go&mdash;may it please God that the king be inclined to call me to his
presence.&rdquo; After saying this, the <i>Waz&#299;r</i> brought them
all along with him as far as the Public Hall of Audience, and leaving
them there, he went into the Private Hall of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1355" href="#xd26e1355" name=

href="#xd26e1357" name="xd26e1357src">18</a> and sent word by the
eunuch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1363src" href="#xd26e1363" name=
"xd26e1363src">19</a> to the royal presence, saying, &ldquo;this old
slave is in waiting, and for many days has not beheld the royal
countenance; he is in hopes that, after one look, he may kiss the royal
feet, then his mind will be at ease.&rdquo; The king heard this request
of his <i>Waz&#299;r</i>, and inasmuch as his majesty knew his length
of services, his zeal, his talents, and his devotedness, and had often
followed his advice, after some consideration, he said, &ldquo;call in
<i>K&#863;hiradmand</i>.&rdquo; As soon as permission was obtained, the
<i>Waz&#299;r</i> appeared in the royal presence, made his obeisance,
and stood with crossed arms.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1379src" href=
"#xd26e1379" name="xd26e1379src">20</a> He saw the king&rsquo;s strange
and altered appearance, that from extreme weeping and emaciation his
eyes were sunk in their sockets,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1382src"
href="#xd26e1382" name="xd26e1382src">21</a> and his visage was
pale.</p>
<p><i>K&#863;hiradmand</i> could no longer restrain himself, but
without choice, ran and threw himself at [the king&rsquo;s] feet. His
majesty lifted up the <i>Waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> head with his hands,
and said, &ldquo;There, thou hast at last seen me; art thou satisfied?
Now go away, and do not disturb me more&mdash;do thou govern the
empire.&rdquo; <i>K&#863;hiradmand</i>, on hearing this, gnashing his
teeth, wept said, &ldquo;This slave, by your favour and welfare, can
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1395" href="#xd26e1395" name=
"xd26e1395">23</a>]</span>always possess a kingdom; but ruin is spread
over the empire from your majesty&rsquo;s such sudden seclusion, and
the end of it will not be prosperous. What strange fancy has possessed
the royal mind! If to this hereditary vassal your majesty will
condescend to explain yourself, it will be for the best&mdash;that I
may unfold whatever occurs to my imperfect judgment on the occasion. If
you have bestowed honours on your slaves, it is for this exigency, that
your majesty may enjoy yourself at your ease, and your slaves regulate
the affairs of the state; for if your imperial highness is to bear this
trouble, which God forbid! of what utility are the servants of the
state?&rdquo; The king replied, &ldquo;Thou sayest true; but the sorrow
which preys on my mind is beyond cure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear, O <i>K&#863;hiradmand!</i> my whole age has been passed
in this vexatious career of conquest, and I am now arrived at these
years; there is only death before me; I have even received a message
from him, for my hairs are turned white. There is a saying; &lsquo;We
have slept all night, and shall we not awake in the morning?&rsquo;
Until now I have not had a son, that I might be easy in mind; for which
reason my heart is very sorrowful, and I have utterly abandoned
everything. Whoever wishes, may take the country and my riches. I have
no use for them. Moreover, I intend some day or other, to quit
everything, retire to the woods and mountains, and not show my face to
any one. In this manner I will pass this life of [at best but] a few
days&rsquo; duration. If some spot pleases me, I shall sit down on it;
and by devoting my time in prayers to God, perhaps my future state will
be happy; this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1402" href=
"#xd26e1402" name="xd26e1402">24</a>]</span>world I have seen well, and
have found no felicity in it.&rdquo; After pronouncing these words, the
king heaved a deep sigh, and became silent.</p>
<p><i>K&#863;hiradmand</i> had been the <i>Waz&#299;r</i> of his
majesty&rsquo;s father, and when the king was heir-apparent he had
loved him; moreover, he was wise and zealous. He said (to
<i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>,) &ldquo;It is ever wrong to despair
of God&rsquo;s grace; He who has created the eighteen thousand species
of living beings<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1414src" href="#xd26e1414"
name="xd26e1414src">22</a> by one fiat, can give you children without
any difficulty. Mighty sire, banish these fanciful notions from your
mind, or else all your subjects will be thrown into confusion, and this
empire,&mdash;with what trouble and pains your royal forefathers and
yourself have erected it!&mdash;will be lost in a moment, and, from
want of care, the whole country will be ruined; God forbid that you
should incur evil fame! Moreover, you will have to answer to God, in
the day of judgment, when he will say, &lsquo;Having made thee a king,
I placed my creatures under thy care; but thou hadst no faith in my
beneficence, and thou hast afflicted thy subjects [by abandoning thy
charge.&rsquo;] What answer will you make to this accusation? Then even
your devotion and prayers will not avail you, for the heart of man is
the abode of God, and kings will have to answer only for the
justice<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1417src" href="#xd26e1417" name=
"xd26e1417src">23</a> of their conduct. Pardon your slave&rsquo;s want
of respect, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1420" href="#xd26e1420"
name="xd26e1420">25</a>]</span>but to leave their homes, and wander
from forest to forest, is the occupation of hermits,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1423src" href="#xd26e1423" name="xd26e1423src">24</a> but not
that of kings. You ought to act according to your allotted station: the
remembering of God, and devotion to him, are not limited to woods or
mountains: your majesty has undoubtedly heard this verse, &lsquo;God is
near him, and he seeks him in the wilderness; the child is in his arms,
and there is a proclamation [of its being lost] throughout the
city.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will be pleased to act impartially, and follow this
slave&rsquo;s advice, in that case the best thing is, that your Majesty
should keep God in mind every moment, and offer up to him your prayers.
No one has yet returned hopeless from his threshold. In the day,
arrange the affairs of state, and administer justice to the poor and
injured; then the creatures of God will repose in peace and comfort
under the skirt of your prosperity. Pray at night; and after beseeching
blessings for the pure spirit of the Prophet, solicit assistance from
recluse <i>Darweshes</i> and holy men, [who are abstracted from worldly
objects and cares;] bestow daily food on orphans, prisoners, poor
parents of numerous children, and helpless widows. From the blessings
of these good works and benevolent intentions, if God please, it is to
be fervently hoped that the objects and desires of your heart will all
be fulfilled, and the circumstances for which the royal mind is
afflicted, will likewise be accomplished, and your noble heart will
rejoice! Look towards the favour <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1443" href="#xd26e1443" name="xd26e1443">26</a>]</span>of God,
for he can in a moment do what he wishes.&rdquo; At length, from such
various representations on the part of <i>K&#863;hiradmand</i> the
<i>Waz&#299;r, &#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht&rsquo;s</i> heart took
courage, and he said, &ldquo;Well, what you say is true; let us see to
this also; and hereafter, the will of God be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king&rsquo;s mind was comforted, he asked the
<i>Waz&#299;r</i> what the other nobles and ministers were doing, and
how they were. He replied, that &ldquo;all the pillars of state are
praying for the life and prosperity of your majesty; and from grief for
your situation, they are all in confusion and dejected. Show the royal
countenance to them, that they may be easy in their minds. Accordingly,
they are now waiting in the <i>D&#299;w&#257;ni &#256;mm</i>.&rdquo; On
hearing this, the king said, &ldquo;If God please, I will hold a court
to-morrow: tell them all to attend.&rdquo; <i>K&#863;hiradmand</i> was
quite rejoiced on hearing this promise, and lifting up his hands,
blessed the king, saying, &ldquo;As long as this earth and heaven
exist, may your majesty&rsquo;s crown and throne remain. Then taking
leave [of the king,] he retired with infinite joy, and communicated
these pleasing tidings to the nobles. All the nobles returned to their
homes with smiles and gladness of heart. The whole city rejoiced, and
the subjects became boundless [in their transports at the idea] that
the king would hold a general court the next day. In the morning, all
the servants of state, noble and menial, and the pillars of state,
small and great, came to the court, and stood each according to his
respective place and degree, and waited with anxiety to behold the
royal splendour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1462" href=
"#xd26e1462" name="xd26e1462">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>When one <i>pahar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1468src" href=
"#xd26e1468" name="xd26e1468src">25</a> of the day had elapsed, all at
once the curtain drew up, and the king, having ascended, seated himself
on the auspicious throne. The sounds of joy struck up in the
<i>Naubat-K&#863;h&#257;na</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1499src"
href="#xd26e1499" name="xd26e1499src">26</a> and all the assembly
offered the <i>naz&#817;ars</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1507src"
href="#xd26e1507" name="xd26e1507src">27</a> of congratulation, and
made their obeisance in the hall of audience. Each was rewarded
according to his respective degree and rank, and the hearts of all
became joyful and easy. At midday<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1513src"
href="#xd26e1513" name="xd26e1513src">28</a> his majesty arose and
retired to the interior of the palace; and after enjoying the royal
repast, retired to rest. From that day the king made this an
established rule, viz., to hold his court every morning, and pass the
afternoons in reading and in the offices of devotion; and after
expressing penitence, and beseeching forgiveness from God, to pray for
the accomplishment of his desires.</p>
<p>One day, the king saw it written in a book, that if any one is so
oppressed with grief and care as not to be relieved by [any human]
contrivance, he ought to commit [his sorrows] to Providence, visit the
tombs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1524" href="#xd26e1524" name=
"xd26e1524">28</a>]</span>of the dead, and pray for the blessing of God
on them,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1526src" href="#xd26e1526" name=
"xd26e1526src">29</a> through the mediation of the Prophet; and
conceiving himself nothing, keep his heart free from the
thoughtlessness of mankind; weep as a warning to others, and behold
[with awe] the power of God, saying, &ldquo;Anterior to me, what mighty
possessors of kingdoms and wealth have been born on earth! but the sky,
involving them all in its revolving circle, has mixed them with the
dust.&rdquo; It is a bye-word, that, &ldquo;on beholding the moving
handmill, <i>Kab&#299;r&#257;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1532src"
href="#xd26e1532" name="xd26e1532src">30</a> weeping, exclaimed,
&lsquo;Alas! nothing has yet survived the pressure of the two
millstones.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if you look [for those heroes], not one vestige of them
remains, except a heap of dust. All of them, leaving their riches and
possessions, their homes and offsprings, their friends and dependants,
their horses and elephants, are lying alone! All these [worldly
advantages] have been of no use to them; moreover, no one by this time,
knows even their names, or who they were; and their state within the
grave cannot be discovered; (for worms, insects, ants, and snakes have
eaten them up;) or [who knows] what has happened to them, or how they
have settled their accounts with God? After meditating on these words
in his mind, he should look on the whole of this world as a perfect
farce; then the flower of his heart will ever bloom, and it will not
wither in any circumstance.&rdquo; When <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1543" href="#xd26e1543" name="xd26e1543">29</a>]</span>the king
read this admonition in the book, he recollected the advice of
<i>K&#863;hiradmand</i> the <i>Waz&#299;r</i>, and found that they
coincided. He became anxious in his mind to put this in execution;
&ldquo;but to mount on horseback, [said his majesty to himself,] and
take a retinue with me, and go like a king, is not becoming; it is
better to change my dress, and go at night and alone to visit the
graves of the dead, or some godly recluse, and keep awake all night;
perhaps by the mediation of these holy men, the desires of this world
and salvation in the next, may be obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having formed this resolution, the king one night put on coarse and
soiled clothes, and taking some money with him, he stole silently out
of the fort, and bent his way over the plain; proceeding onwards, he
arrived at a cemetery, and was repeating his prayers with a sincere
heart. At that time, a fierce wind continued blowing, and might be
called a storm. Suddenly the king saw a flame at a distance which shone
like the morning star; he said to himself, &ldquo;In this storm and
darkness this light cannot shine without art, or it may be a talisman;
for if nitre and sulphur be sprinkled in the lamp, around the wick,
then let the wind be ever so strong, the flame will not be
extinguished&mdash;or may it not be the lamp of some holy man which
burns? Let it be what it may, I ought to go and examine it; perhaps by
the light of this lamp, the lamp of my house also may be
lighted,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1553src" href="#xd26e1553" name=
"xd26e1553src">31</a> and the wish of my heart fulfilled.&rdquo; Having
formed this resolution, the king advanced in that direction; when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1556" href="#xd26e1556" name=
"xd26e1556">30</a>]</span>he drew near, he saw four erratic
<i>fa&#7731;&#299;rs</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1561src" href=
"#xd26e1561" name="xd26e1561src">32</a> with
<i>kafn&#299;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1568src" href=
"#xd26e1568" name="xd26e1568src">33</a> on their bodies, and their head
reclined on their knees; sitting in profound silence, and senselessly
abstracted. Their state was such as that of a traveller, who, separated
from his country and his sect, friendless and alone, and overwhelmed
with grief, is desponding and at a loss. In the same manner sat these
four <i>Fa&#7731;&#299;rs</i>, like statues,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1581src" href="#xd26e1581" name="xd26e1581src">34</a> and a lamp
placed on a stone burnt brightly; the wind touched it not, as if the
sky itself had been its shade,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1584src"
href="#xd26e1584" name="xd26e1584src">35</a> so that it burnt without
danger [of being extinguished.]</p>
<p>On seeing this sight, <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> was
convinced [and said to himself] that &ldquo;assuredly thy desires will
be fulfilled, by the blessing [resulting from] the footsteps of these
men of God; and the withered tree of thy hopes shall revive by their
looks, and yield fruit. Go into their company, and tell thy story, and
join their society; perhaps they may feel pity for thee, and offer up
for thee such a prayer as may be accepted by the Almighty.&rdquo;
Having formed this determination, he was about to step forward, when
his judgment told him, O fool, do not be hasty! Look a little [before
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1595" href="#xd26e1595" name=
"xd26e1595">31</a>]</span>thee.] What dost thou know as to who they
are, from whence they have come, and where they are going? How can we
know but they may be <i>Devs</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1599src"
href="#xd26e1599" name="xd26e1599src">36</a> or

assuming the appearance of men, are sitting together? In every way, to
be in haste, and go amongst them and disturb them, is improper. At
present, hide thyself in some corner, and learn the story of these
<i>Darweshes</i>.&rdquo; At last the king did so, and hid himself in a
corner with such silence, that no one heard the sound of his approach;
he directed his attention towards them to hear what they were saying
amongst themselves. By chance one of the <i>Fa&#7731;&#299;rs</i>
sneezed, and said, &ldquo;God be praised.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

trimmed the lamp; the flame was burning bright, and each of them
sitting on his mattrass, lighted their

faithful wanderers over the world! we four persons, by the revolution
of the heavens, and changes of day and night, with dust on our heads,
have wandered for some time, from door to door. God be praised, that by
the aid of our good fortune, and the decree of fate, we have to-day met
each other on this spot. The events of to-morrow are not in the least
known, nor what will happen; whether we remain together, or become
totally separated; the night is a heavy load,<a class="noteref" id=

retire to sleep so early is not salutary. It is far better that we
relate, each on his own part, the events which have passed over our
heads in this world, without admitting a particle of untruth [in our
narrations;] then the night will pass away in words, and when little of
it remains, let us retire to rest.&rdquo; They all replied, &ldquo;O

history, and relate what you have seen; then shall we be
edified.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1678" href=

<i>Naush&#299;rw&#257;n</i> was a king of Persia, who died in A.D. 578.
He is celebrated in oriental history for his wisdom and justice. During
his reign <i>Muh&#803;ammad</i> the prophet was born. The Persian

now become its master in the room of your father; be vigilant in your
affairs and transactions.&rdquo; After consoling me [in this friendly
manner,] they took their leave. All the agents, factors and
employ&eacute;s [of my late father] came and waited on me; they
presented their <i>naz&#817;ars</i>, and said, &ldquo;Be pleased to
behold with your own auspicious eye the cash in the coffers, and the
merchandise in the warehouses.&rdquo; When all at once my sight fell on
this boundless wealth, my eyes expanded. I gave orders for the fitting
up of a <i>d&#299;w&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1811src" href="#xd26e1811" name="xd26e1811src">9</a> the

the <i>pardas</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1832src" href="#xd26e1832"
name="xd26e1832src">11</a> and magnificent <i>chicks</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1841src" href="#xd26e1841" name=
"xd26e1841src">12</a> I took handsome servants into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1858" href="#xd26e1858" name=
"xd26e1858">36</a>]</span>my service; and caused them to be clothed in
rich dresses out of my treasury. This mendicant had no sooner reposed
himself in [the vacant] seat [of his father] than he was surrounded by
fops, coxcombs, &ldquo;thiggars<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1860src"
href="#xd26e1860" name="xd26e1860src">13</a> and sornars,&rdquo; liars
and flatterers, who became his favourites and friends. I began to have
them constantly in my company. They amused me with the gossip of every
place, and every idle, lying tittle tattle; they continued urging me
thus. &ldquo;In this season of youth, you ought to drink<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1866src" href="#xd26e1866" name=
"xd26e1866src">14</a> of the choicest wines, and send for beautiful
mistresses to participate in the pleasures thereof, and enjoy yourself
in their company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, the evil genius of man is man: my disposition changed from
listening constantly [to their pernicious advice.] Wine, dancing, and
gaming occupied my time. At last matters came to such a pitch, that,
forgetting my commercial concerns, a mania for debauchery and gambling
came over me. My servants and companions, when they perceived my
careless habits, secreted all they could lay hand on; one might say a
systematic plunder took place. No account was kept of the money which
was squandered; from whence it came, or where it went:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When the wealth comes gratuitously, the heart
has no mercy on it.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1880src" href=
"#xd26e1880" name="xd26e1880src">15</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1882" href="#xd26e1882" name=
"xd26e1882">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Had I possessed even the treasures of
<i>&#7730;&#257;r&#363;n</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1888src" href=
"#xd26e1888" name="xd26e1888src">16</a> they would not have been
sufficient to supply this vast expenditure. In the course of a few
years such became all at once my condition, that, a bare skull cap for
my head, and a rag about my loins, were all that remained. Those
friends who used to share my board, and [who so often swore]<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1891src" href="#xd26e1891" name=
"xd26e1891src">17</a> to shed their blood by the spoonful for my
advantage, disappeared; yea, even if I met them by chance on the
highway, they used to withdraw their looks and turn aside their faces
from me; moreover, my servants, of every description, left me, and went
away; no one remained to enquire after me, and say, &ldquo;what state
is this you are reduced to?&rdquo; I had no companion left but my grief
and regret.</p>
<p>I now had not a half-farthing&rsquo;s worth of parched grain [to
grind between my jaws,] and give a relish to the water I drank: I
endured two or three severe fasts, but could no longer bear [the
cravings of] hunger. From necessity, covering my face with the mask of
shamelessness, I formed the resolution of going to my sister; but this
shame continued to come into my mind, that, since the death of my
father, I had kept up no friendly intercourse with her, or even written
her a single line; nay, further, she had written me two or three
letters of condolence and affection, to which I had not deigned to make
any reply in my inebriated moments of prosperity. From this sense of
shame my heart felt no inclination [to go to my sister,] <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1908" href="#xd26e1908" name=
"xd26e1908">38</a>]</span>but except her house, I had no other [to
which I could resort.] In the best way I could, on foot, empty-handed,
with much fatigue and a thousand toils, having traversed the few
[intervening] stages, I arrived at the city where my sister lived, and
reached her house. My sister, seeing my wretched state, invoked a
blessing upon me, embraced me with affection, and wept bitterly; she
distributed [the customary offerings to the poor] on the occasion of my
safe arrival, such as oil, vegetables, and small coins,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1910src" href="#xd26e1910" name=
"xd26e1910src">18</a> and said to me, &ldquo;Though my heart is greatly
rejoiced at this meeting, yet, brother, in what sad plight do I see
you?&rdquo; I could make her no reply, but shedding tears, I remained
silent. My sister sent me quickly to the bath, after having ordered a
splendid dress to be sewn for me. I having bathed and washed, put on
these clothes. She fixed on an elegant apartment, near her own, for my
residence. I had in the morning <i>sharbat</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1919src" href="#xd26e1919" name="xd26e1919src">19</a> and various
kinds of sweetmeats for my breakfast; in the afternoon, fresh and dried
fruits for my luncheon; and at dinner and supper she having procured
for me <i>pul&#257;os</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1934src" href=
"#xd26e1934" name="xd26e1934src">20</a> <i>kab&#257;bs</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1945src" href="#xd26e1945" name=
"xd26e1945src">21</a> and bread of the most exquisite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1953" href="#xd26e1953" name=
"xd26e1953">39</a>]</span>flavour and delicious cookery; she saw me eat
them in her own presence; and in every manner she took care of me. I
offered thousands upon thousands of thanksgivings to God for enjoying
such comfort, after such affliction [as I had suffered.] Several months
passed in this tranquillity, during which I never put my foot out of my
apartment.</p>
<p>One day, my sister, who treated me like a mother, said to me,
&ldquo;O brother, you are the delight of my eyes, and the living emblem
of the dead dust of our parents; by your arrival the longing of my
heart is satisfied; whenever I see you, I am infinitely rejoiced; you
have made me completely happy; but God has created men to work for
their living, and they ought not to sit idle at home. If a man becomes
idle and stays at home, the people of the world cast unfavourable
reflections on him; more especially the people of this city, both great
and little, though it concerns them not, will say, on your remaining
[with me and doing nothing,] &lsquo;That having lavished and spent his
father&rsquo;s worldly wealth, he is now living on the scraps from his
brother-in-law&rsquo;s board.&rsquo; This is an excessive want of
proper pride, and will be our ridicule, and the subject of shame to the
memory of our parents; otherwise I would keep you near my heart, and
make you shoes of my own skin, and have you wear them. Now, my advice
is that you should make an effort at travelling; please God the times
will change, and in place of your present embarrassment and
destitution, gladness and prosperity may be the result.&rdquo; On
hearing this speech my pride was roused; I approved of her advice, and
replied, very well, you are now in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1957" href="#xd26e1957" name="xd26e1957">40</a>]</span>the place
of my mother, and I will do whatever you say. Having thus received my
consent, she went into the interior of her house, and brought out, by
the assistance of her female slaves and servants, fifty
<i>to&#7771;&#257;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e1961src" href=
"#xd26e1961" name="xd26e1961src">22</a> of gold and laid them before
me, saying, &ldquo;A caravan of merchants is on the point of setting
out for Damascus.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1976src" href="#xd26e1976"
name="xd26e1976src">23</a> Do you purchase with this money some
articles of merchandise. Having put them under the care of a merchant
of probity, take from him a proper receipt for them: and do you also
proceed to Damascus. When you arrive there in safety, receive the
amount sales of your goods, and the profit which may accrue [from your
merchant,] or sell them yourself [as may be most convenient or
advantageous.&rdquo;] I took the money and went to the
<i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1988src" href=
"#xd26e1988" name="xd26e1988src">24</a> and having bought articles of
merchandise, I delivered them over in charge to an eminent merchant,
and set my mind at ease on receiving a satisfactory receipt from him.
The merchant embarked with the goods on board a vessel, and set off by
sea,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2001src" href="#xd26e2001" name=
"xd26e2001src">25</a> and I prepared to go by land. When I took leave
of my excellent sister, she gave me a rich dress and a superb horse
with jewelled harness; she put some <span class="corr" id="xd26e2004"
title="Source: sweatmeats">sweetmeats</span> in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2007" href="#xd26e2007" name=
"xd26e2007">41</a>]</span>leather bag and hung it to the pummel of my
saddle, and she suspended a flask of water from the crupper; she tied a
sacred rupee on my arm,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2009src" href=
"#xd26e2009" name="xd26e2009src">26</a> and having marked my forehead
with <i>&#7789;&#299;k&#257;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2021src"
href="#xd26e2021" name="xd26e2021src">27</a> &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo;
said she, suppressing her tears, &ldquo;I have put thee under the
protection of God; thou showest thy back in going, in the same happy
state show me soon your face.&rdquo; I also said, after repeating the
prayer of welfare, &ldquo;God be your protector also. I obey your
commands.&rdquo; Coming out from thence, I mounted my horse, and having
placed my reliance on the protection of the Almighty, I set forward,
and throwing two stages into one, I soon reached the neighbourhood of
Damascus.</p>
<p>In short, when I arrived at the city gate, the night was far
advanced, and the door-keepers and guards had shut them. I made much
entreaty, and added, &ldquo;I am a traveller, who has come a long
journey, at a great rate; if you would kindly open the gates, I could
get into the city and procure some refreshment for myself and my
horse.&rdquo; They rudely replied from within, &ldquo;There is no order
to open the gates at this hour; why have you come so late in the
night?&rdquo; When I heard this plain answer of theirs, I alighted from
my horse under the walls of the city, and spreading my housing, I sat
down; but to keep awake, I often rose up and walked about. When it was
exactly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2039" href="#xd26e2039"
name="xd26e2039">42</a>]</span>midnight,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2041src" href="#xd26e2041" name="xd26e2041src">28</a> there was a
dead silence. What do I see but a chest descending slowly from the
walls of the fortress! When I beheld this [strange sight], I was filled
with surprise, thinking what talisman is this! perhaps God, taking pity
on my perplexity and my misfortunes, has sent me here some bounty from
his hidden treasure. When the chest rested on the ground, I approached
it with much fear, and perceived it was of wood. Instigated by
curiosity, I opened it; I beheld in it a beautiful lovely woman (at the
sight of whom the senses would vanish), wounded and weltering in her
blood, with her eyes closed, and in extreme agonies. By degrees her
lips moved, and these sounds issued slowly from her mouth, &ldquo;O
faithless wretch! O barbarous tyrant! Is this deed which thou hast
done, the return I merited for all my affection and kindness! Well,
well! give me another blow [and complete thy cruelty]: I entrust to God
the executing of justice between myself and thee.&rdquo; After
pronouncing these words, even in that insensible state, she drew the
end of her <i>dopa&#7789;&#7789;&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2046src" href="#xd26e2046" name="xd26e2046src">29</a> over her
face; she did not look towards me.</p>
<p>Gazing on her, and hearing her exclamations, I became torpid. It
occurred to me, what savage tyrant could wound so beautiful a lady!
what [demon] possessed his heart, and how could he lift his hand
against her! she still loves him,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2060src"
href="#xd26e2060" name="xd26e2060src">30</a> and even in this agony of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2068" href="#xd26e2068" name=
"xd26e2068">43</a>]</span>death, she recollects him! I was muttering
this to myself; the sound reached her ear; drawing at once her veil
from her face, she looked at me. The moment her looks met mine, I
nearly fainted, and my heart throbbed with difficulty; I supported
myself by a strong effort, and taking courage, I asked her, &ldquo;tell
me true, who art you, and what sad occurrence is this I see; if you
will explain it, then it will give ease to my heart.&rdquo; On hearing
these words, though she had scarce strength to speak, yet she slowly
uttered, &ldquo;I thank you! how can I speak? my condition, owing to my
wounds, is what you see; I am your guest for a few moments only; when
my spirit shall depart, then, for God&rsquo;s sake, act like a man, and
bury unfortunate me in some place, in this chest; then I shall be freed
from the tongue of the good and bad, and you will earn for yourself a
future reward.&rdquo; After pronouncing these words, she became
silent.</p>
<p>In the night I could apply no remedy; I brought the chest near me,
and began to count the <i>gha&#7771;&#299;s</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2074src" href="#xd26e2074" name="xd26e2074src">31</a> of the
remaining night. I determined, when the morning came, to go into the
city and do all in my power for the cure [of this beautiful woman]. The
short, remaining night became so heavy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2092src" href="#xd26e2092" name="xd26e2092src">32</a> a load,
that my heart <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2095" href=
"#xd26e2095" name="xd26e2095">44</a>]</span>was quite restless. At
last, after suffering much uneasiness, the morning approached&mdash;the
cock crowed, and the voices of men were heard. After performing the
morning prayer, I inclosed the chest in a coarse canvas sack, and just
as the gates opened, I entered the city. I began to inquire of every
man and shop-keeper where I could find a mansion for hire; and after
much search, I found a convenient, handsome house, which I rented. The
first thing I did, was to take that beautiful woman out of the chest,
and lay her on a soft bed made up of flocks of cotton, which I had
removed to a corner. I then placed a trusty person near her, and went
in search of a surgeon. I wandered about, asking of every one I met who
was the cleverest surgeon in the city, and where he lived. One person
said, &ldquo;There is a certain barber who is unique in the practice of
surgery, and the science of physic; and in these arts is quite perfect.
If you carry a dead person to him, by the help of God, he will apply
such remedies as will bring him to life. He dwells in this quarter [of
the city,] and his name is
<i>&rsquo;&#298;s&#257;&#803;</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2100src" href="#xd26e2100" name="xd26e2100src">33</a></p>
<p>On hearing this agreeable intelligence, I went in search of him, and
after several inquiries, I found out his abode from the directions I
had received. I saw a man with a white beard sitting under the portico
of his door, and several men were grinding materials for plasters
beside him. For the sake of complimenting <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2119" href="#xd26e2119" name="xd26e2119">45</a>]</span>him, I
made him a respectful <i>sal&#257;m</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2124src" href="#xd26e2124" name="xd26e2124src">34</a> and
said,&mdash;&ldquo;having heard of your name and excellent qualities, I
am come [to solicit your assistance.] The case is this: I set out from
my country for the purpose of trade, and took my wife with me, from the
great affection I had for her; when I arrived near this city, I halted
at a little distance, as the evening had set in. I did not think it
safe to travel at night in an unseen country; I therefore rested under
a tree on the plains. At the last quarter of the night, I was attacked
by robbers; they plundered me of all the money and the property they
could find, and wounded my wife, from avidity for her jewels. I could
make no resistance, and passed the remainder of the night as well as I
could. Early in the morning I came into this city, and rented a house;
leaving her there, I am come to you with all speed. God has given you
this perfection in your profession; favour this [unfortunate]
traveller, and come to his humble dwelling; see my wife, and if her
life should be saved, then you will acquire great fame, and I will be
your slave as long as I live.&rdquo; <i>&rsquo;&#298;s&#257;&#803;</i>,
the surgeon, was very humane and devout; he took pity on my misfortune,
and accompanied me to my house. On examining the wounds, he gave me
hopes, and said, &ldquo;By the blessing of God, this lady&rsquo;s
wounds will be cured in forty days; and I will then cause to be
administered to her the ablution of cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, the good man having thoroughly washed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2141" href="#xd26e2141" name=
"xd26e2141">46</a>]</span>all the wounds with the decoction of
<i>n&#299;m</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2146src" href="#xd26e2146"
name="xd26e2146src">35</a> he cleansed them; those that he found fit
for stitching, he sewed up; and on the others he laid lint and
plasters, which he took out of his box, and tied them up with bandages,
and said with much kindness, &ldquo;I will continue to call morning and
evening; be thou careful that she remain perfectly quiet, so that the
stitches may not give way; let her food be chicken broth administered
in small quantities at a time, and give her often the spirit of
<i>Bed-Mushk</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2155src" href="#xd26e2155"
name="xd26e2155src">36</a> with rose water, so that her strength may be
supported.&rdquo; After giving these directions, he took his leave. I
thanked him much with joined hands,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2165src"
href="#xd26e2165" name="xd26e2165src">37</a> and added, &ldquo;From the
consolation you have bestowed, my life also has been restored;
otherwise, I saw nothing but death before me; God keep you safe.&rdquo;
And after giving him <i>&rsquo;It&#804;r</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2170src" href="#xd26e2170" name="xd26e2170src">38</a> and
<i>betel</i>, I took leave of him. Night and day I attended on that
beautiful lady with the utmost solicitude; rest to myself I renounced
as impious, and in the threshold of God I daily prayed for her
cure.</p>
<p>It came to pass that the merchant [who had charge of my
merchandise,] arrived, and delivered over to me <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2184" href="#xd26e2184" name=
"xd26e2184">47</a>]</span>the goods I had entrusted to his care. I sold
them as occasion required, and began to spend the amount in medicines
and remedies. The good surgeon was regular in his attendance, and in a
short time all the wounds filled up, and began to heal; a few days
after she performed the ablution of cure. Joy of a wonderful nature
arose [in my heart]! A rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2189src" href="#xd26e2189" name=
"xd26e2189src">39</a> and [a purse of] gold pieces I laid before
<i>&rsquo;&#298;s&#257;&#803;</i>, the surgeon. I ordered elegant
carpets to be spread for that fair one<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2210src" href="#xd26e2210" name="xd26e2210src">40</a>, and caused
her to sit upon the <i>masnad</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2220src"
href="#xd26e2220" name="xd26e2220src">41</a> I distributed large sums
to the poor [on the joyous occasion,] and that day I was as happy as if
I had gained possession of the sovereignty of the seven
climes.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2234src" href="#xd26e2234" name=
"xd26e2234src">42</a> On that beautiful lady&rsquo;s cure, such rosy,
pure colour appeared in her complexion, that her face shone like the
sun, and sparkled with the lustre of the purest gold. I could not gaze
on her without being dazzled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2237"
href="#xd26e2237" name="xd26e2237">48</a>]</span>with her
beauty.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2239src" href="#xd26e2239" name=
"xd26e2239src">43</a> I devoted myself entirely to her services, and
zealously performed whatever she commanded. In the full pride of beauty
and consciousness of high rank, if ever she condescended to cast a look
on me, she used to say, &ldquo;Take care, if my good opinion is
desirable to you, then never breathe a syllable in my affairs; whatever
I order, perform without objection; never utter a breath in my
concerns, otherwise you will repent.&rdquo; It appeared, however, from
her manners, that the return due to me for my services and obedience,
was fully impressed on her mind. I also did nothing without her
consent, and executed her commands with implicit obedience.</p>
<p>A certain space of time passed away in this mystery and
submission&mdash;I instantly procured for her whatever she desired. I
spent all the money I had from the sale of my goods, both principal and
interest. In a foreign country [where I was unknown], who would trust
me? that by borrowing, affairs might go on. At last, I was distressed
for money, even for our daily expenses, and thence my heart became much
embarrassed. With this anxious solicitude I pined daily, and the colour
fled from my face; but to whom could I speak [for aid]? What my heart
suffered, that it must suffer. &ldquo;The grief of the poor man [preys]
on his own soul.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2244src" href=
"#xd26e2244" name="xd26e2244src">44</a> One day the beautiful lady,
from her own penetration, perceived [my distressed state] and said,
&ldquo;O youth! my obligations [to you] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2247" href="#xd26e2247" name="xd26e2247">49</a>]</span>for the
services [you have rendered] me are engraven on my heart as indelible
as on stone; but their return I am unable to make at present. If there
be any thing required for necessary expenses, do not be distressed on
that account, but bring me a slip of paper, pen, and ink.&rdquo; I was
then convinced that this fair lady must be a princess of some country,
or else she would not have addressed me with such boldness and
haughtiness. I instantly brought her the writing materials,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2249src" href="#xd26e2249" name=
"xd26e2249src">45</a> and placed them before her&mdash;she having
written a note in a fair hand, delivered it to me, and said,
&ldquo;There is a <i>Tirpauliy&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2257src" href="#xd26e2257" name="xd26e2257src">46</a> near the
fort; in the adjoining street is a large mansion, and the master of
that house is called <i>S&#299;d&#299; Bah&#257;r</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2266src" href="#xd26e2266" name=
"xd26e2266src">47</a> go and deliver this note to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went according to her commands, and by the name and address she
had given me, I soon found out the house; by the porter I sent word of
the circumstance [of my having brought] a letter. The moment he heard
[my message,] a handsome young negro, with a flashy turban on his head,
came out to me; though his colour was dark, his countenance was full of
animation. He took the note from my hand, but said nothing, asked no
questions, and at the same pace [without a pause] entered the house. In
a short time he came out, accompanied by slaves, who carried
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2274" href="#xd26e2274" name=
"xd26e2274">50</a>]</span>on their heads eleven sealed trays covered
with brocade. He told the slaves, &ldquo;Go with this young man, and
deliver these trays.&rdquo; I, having made my salutation, took my leave
of him, and brought [the slaves with their burdens] to our house. I
dismissed the men from the door, and carried in the trays entrusted to
me to the presence of the fair lady. On seeing them she said,
&ldquo;Take these eleven bags of gold pieces and appropriate the money
to necessary expenses; God is most bountiful.&rdquo; I took the gold,
and began to lay it out in immediate necessaries. Although I became
more easy in my mind, yet this perplexity continued in my heart.
&ldquo;O God, [said I to myself,] what a strange circumstance is this!
that a stranger, whose person is unknown to me, should, on the mere
sight of a bit of paper, have delivered over to me so much money
without question or inquiry. I cannot ask the fair lady to explain the
mystery, as she has beforehand forbidden me.&rdquo; Through fear, I was
unable to breathe a syllable.</p>
<p>Eight days after this occurrence, the beloved fair one thus
addressed me:&mdash;&ldquo;God has bestowed on man the robe of humanity
which may not be torn or soiled; and although tattered clothes are no
disparagement to his manhood, yet in public, in the eyes of the world
he has no respect paid to him [if shabbily clothed]. So take two bags
of gold with thee, and go to the <i>chauk</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2281src" href="#xd26e2281" name="xd26e2281src">48</a> to the shop
of <i>Y&#363;suf</i> the merchant, and buy there some sets of jewels of
high value, and two rich suits of clothes, and bring them with
thee.&rdquo; I instantly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2290" href=
"#xd26e2290" name="xd26e2290">51</a>]</span>mounted my horse, and went
to the shop described. I saw there a handsome young man, clothed in a
saffron-coloured dress, seated on a cushion; his beauty<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2292src" href="#xd26e2292" name=
"xd26e2292src">49</a> was such, that a whole multitude stopped in the
street from his shop as far as the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> to gaze at
him. I approached him with perfect pleasure, having made my
&ldquo;<i>sal&#257;m &rsquo;alaika</i>.&rdquo; I sat down, and
mentioned the articles required. My pronunciation was not like that of
the inhabitants of that city. The young merchant replied with great
kindness, &ldquo;Whatever you require is ready, but tell me, sir, from
what country are you come, and what are the motives of your stay in
this foreign city? If you will condescend to inform me on these points,
it will not be remote from kindness.&rdquo; It was not agreeable to me
to divulge my circumstances, so I made up some story, took the jewels
and the clothes, paid their price, and begged to take my leave. The
young man seemed displeased and said, &ldquo;O sir, if you wished to be
so reserved, it was not necessary to show such warmth of friendly
greeting in your first approach. Amongst well-bred people
these<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2305src" href="#xd26e2305" name=
"xd26e2305src">50</a> amicable greetings are of much
consideration.&rdquo; He pronounced this speech with such elegance and
propriety, that it quite delighted my heart, and I did not think it
courteous to be unkind and leave<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2314src"
href="#xd26e2314" name="xd26e2314src">51</a> him so hastily; therefore,
to please him, I sat down again and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2323" href="#xd26e2323" name="xd26e2323">52</a>]</span>said, I
agree to your request with all my heart,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2325src" href="#xd26e2325" name="xd26e2325src">52</a> and am
ready [to obey your commands.]</p>
<p>He was greatly pleased with my compliance, and smiling he said,
&ldquo;If you will honour my poor mansion [with your company] to-day,
then having a party of pleasure, we shall regale our hearts for some
hours [in good cheer and hilarity.&rdquo;] I had never left the fair
lady alone [since we first met,] and recollecting her solitary
situation, I made many excuses, but that young man would not accept
any; at last, having extorted from me a promise to return as soon as I
had carried home the articles I had purchased, and having made me swear
[to that effect,] he gave me leave to depart. I, having left the shop,
carried the jewels and the clothes to the presence of the fair lady.
She asked the price of the different articles, and what passed at the
merchant&rsquo;s. I related all the particulars of the purchase, and
the teasing invitation I had received from him. She replied, &ldquo;It
is incumbent on man to fulfil whatever promise he may make; leave me
under the protection of God, and fulfil your engagement; the law of the
prophet requires we should accept the offers of hospitality.&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;My heart does not wish to go and leave you alone, but such
are your orders, and I am forced to go; until I return, my heart will
be attached to this very spot.&rdquo; Saying this, I went to the
merchant&rsquo;s: he, seated on a chair, was waiting for me. On seeing
me, he said, &ldquo;Come, good sir, you have made me wait
long.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2333src" href="#xd26e2333"
name="xd26e2333src">53</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2344"
href="#xd26e2344" name="xd26e2344">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>He instantly arose, seized my hand, and moved on; proceeding along,
he conducted me to a garden; it was a garden of great beauty; in the
basons and canals fountains were playing; fruits of various kinds were
in full bloom, and the branches of the trees were bent down with their
weight;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2347src" href="#xd26e2347" name=
"xd26e2347src">54</a> birds of various species were perched on the
boughs, and sung their merry notes, and elegant carpets were spread in
every apartment [of the grand pavilion which stood in the centre of the
garden]. There on the border of the canal, we sat down in an elegant
saloon; he got up a moment after and went out, and then returned richly
dressed. On seeing him, I exclaimed, &ldquo;Praised be the Lord, may
the evil eye be averted!&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2353src"
href="#xd26e2353" name="xd26e2353src">55</a> On hearing this,
exclamation, he smiled, and said, &ldquo;It is fit you, too, should
change your dress.&rdquo; To please him, I also put on other clothes.
The young merchant, with much sumptuousness, prepared an elegant
entertainment, and provided every article of pleasure that could be
desired; he was warm in his expressions of attachment to me, and his
conversation was quite enchanting. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2362" href="#xd26e2362" name="xd26e2362">54</a>]</span>At this
moment a cupbearer appeared with a flask [of wine] and a crystal cup,
and delicious meats of various kinds were served up. The salt-cellars
were set in order, and the sparkling cup began to circulate. When it
had performed three or four revolutions, four young dancing boys, very
beautiful, with loose, flowing tresses, entered the assembly, and began
to sing and play. Such was the scene, and such the melody, that had
<i>T&#257;n-Se&#7749;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2366src" href=
"#xd26e2366" name="xd26e2366src">56</a> been present at that hour, he
would have forgot his strains; and
<i>Baij&#363;-B&#257;,or&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2378src"
href="#xd26e2378" name="xd26e2378src">57</a> would have gone mad. In
the midst of this festivity, the young merchant&rsquo;s eyes filled
suddenly with tears, and involuntarily two or three drops trickled down
[his cheeks]; he turned round and said to me, &ldquo;Now between us a
friendship for life is formed; to hide the secrets of our hearts is
approved by no religion. I am going to impart a secret to you, in the
confidence of friendship and without reserve. If you will give me leave
I will send for my mistress into our company, and exhilarate my heart
[with her presence]; for in her absence, I cannot enjoy any
pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pronounced these words with such eager desire, that though I had
not seen her, yet my heart longed for her. I replied, your happiness is
essential to me, what can be better [than what you propose]; send for
her without delay; nothing, it is true, is agreeable without the
presence of the beloved one. The young merchant <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2399" href="#xd26e2399" name=
"xd26e2399">55</a>]</span>made a sign towards the <i>chick</i> and
shortly a black woman, as ugly as an ogress, on seeing whom one would
die without [the intervention of] fate, approached the young man and
sat down. I was frightened at her sight, and said within myself, is it
possible this she-demon can be beloved by so beautiful a young man, and
is this the creature he praised<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2404src"
href="#xd26e2404" name="xd26e2404src">58</a> so highly, and spoke of
with such affection! I muttered the form of exorcism,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2416src" href="#xd26e2416" name="xd26e2416src">59</a> and
became silent. In this same condition, the festive scene of wine and
music continued for three days and nights; on the fourth night,
intoxication and sleep gained the victory; I, in the sleep of
forgetfulness, involuntarily slumbered; next morning the young merchant
wakened me, and made me drink some cups of a cooling and sedative
nature. He said to his mistress, &ldquo;To trouble our guest any longer
would be improper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then took hold of both my hands, and we stood up. I begged leave
to depart; well pleased [with my complaisance], he gave me permission
[to return home]. I then quickly put on my former clothes, and bent my
way homewards, waited on the angelic lady. But it had never before
occurred in my case, to leave her by herself and remain out all night.
I was quite ashamed of myself for being absent three days [and nights],
and I made her many apologies, and related the whole <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2435" href="#xd26e2435" name=
"xd26e2435">56</a>]</span>circumstances of the entertainment, and his
not permitting me [to come home sooner]. She was well acquainted with
the manners of the world, and smiling said, &ldquo;What does it
signify, if you had to remain to oblige your friend; I cheerfully
pardon you, where is the blame on your part; when a man goes on
occasions of this sort to any person&rsquo;s house, he returns when the
other pleases to let him. But you having eaten and drunk at his
entertainments for nothing, will you remain silent, or give him a feast
in return? Now I think it proper you should go to the young merchant,
and bring him with you, and feast him two-fold greater than he did you.
Give yourself no concern about the materials [for such an
entertainment]; by the favour of God, all the requisites will soon be
ready, and in an excellent style, the hospitable party will obtain
splendour.&rdquo; According to her desire, I went to the jeweller, and
said to him, &ldquo;I have complied with your request most cheerfully,
now do you also in the way of friendship, grant my request.&rdquo; He
said, &ldquo;I will obey you with heart and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said, &ldquo;If you will honour your humble servant&rsquo;s
house with a visit, it will be the essence of condescension. That young
man made many excuses and evasions, but I would not give up the point.
When [at length] he consented, I brought him with me to my house; but
on the way I could not avoid making the reflection, that &ldquo;if I
had had the means, I could receive my guest in a style which would be
highly gratifying to him. Now I am taking him with me, let us see what
will be the result.&rdquo; Absorbed in these apprehensions, I drew near
my house. Then how was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2439" href=
"#xd26e2439" name="xd26e2439">57</a>]</span>I surprised to see a great
crowd and bustle at the door; the street had been swept and watered;
silver mace and club bearers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2441src" href=
"#xd26e2441" name="xd26e2441src">60</a> were in waiting. I wondered
greatly [at what I saw], but knowing it to be mine own house, I
entered, and perceived that elegant carpets befitting every apartment,
were spread in all directions, and rich <i>masnads</i> were laid out.
<i>Betel</i> boxes, <i>gul&#257;b-p&#257;shes,
&rsquo;it&#804;r-d&#257;ns, p&#299;k-d&#363;ns</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2452src" href="#xd26e2452" name="xd26e2452src">61</a> flower
pots, narcissus-pots, were all arranged in order. In the recesses of
the walls, various kinds of oranges and confectionery of various
colours were placed. On one side variegated screens of <i>talk</i>,
with lights behind them were displayed, and on the other side tall
branches of lamps in the shape of cypresses and lotuses, were lighted
up. In the hall and alcove camphorated candles were placed in golden
candlesticks, and rich glass shades were placed over thorn; every
attendant waited at his respective post. In the kitchen the pots
continued jingling; and in the
<i>&#257;bd&#257;r-k&#863;h&#257;na</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2473src" href="#xd26e2473" name="xd26e2473src">62</a> there was a
corresponding preparation; jars of water, quite new, stood on silver
stands, with percolators attached, and covered with lids. Further on,
on a platform, were placed spoons and cups, with salvers and covers;
<i>kulfis</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2484src" href="#xd26e2484"
name="xd26e2484src">63</a> of ice were arranged, and the
goglets<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2487src" href="#xd26e2487" name=
"xd26e2487src">64</a> were being agitated in saltpetre. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2490" href="#xd26e2490" name=
"xd26e2490">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>In short, every requisite becoming a prince was displayed. Dancing
girls and boys, singers, musicians and buffoons, in rich apparel, were
in waiting, and singing in concert. I led the young merchant in, and
seated him on the <i>masnad</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2496src"
href="#xd26e2496" name="xd26e2496src">65</a> I was all amazement [and
said to myself] &ldquo;O God, in so short a time how have such
preparations been made?&rdquo; I was staring around and walking about
in every direction, but I could nowhere perceive a trace of the
beautiful lady; searching for her, I went into the kitchen, and I saw
her there, with an upper garment on her neck, slippers on her feet, and
a white handkerchief thrown over her head, plain and simply dressed,
and without any jewels.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;She on whom God hath bestowed beauty has no need
of ornaments;</p>
<p class="line">Behold how beautiful appears the moon, without
decorations.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">She was busily employed in the superintendence of the
feast, and was giving directions for the eatables, saying, &ldquo;have
a care that [this dish] may be savoury, and that its moisture, its
seasoning and its fragrance, may be quite correct.&rdquo; In this toil
that rose-like person was all over perspiration.</p>
<p>I approached her with reverence, and having expressed my admiration
of her good sense, and the propriety of her conduct, I invoked
blessings upon her. On hearing my compliments, she was displeased, and
said, &ldquo;various deeds are done on the part of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2517" href="#xd26e2517" name=
"xd26e2517">59</a>]</span>human beings which it is not the power of
angels [to perform]: what have I done that thou art so much astonished?
Enough, I dislike much talk; but say, what manners is this to leave
your guest alone, and amuse yourself by staring about; what will he
think of your behaviour? return quickly to the company, and attend to
your guest, and send for his mistress, and make her sit by him.&rdquo;
I instantly returned to the young merchant, and shewed him every
friendly attention. Soon after, two handsome slaves entered with
bottles of delicious wine, and cups set with precious stones, and
served us the liquor. In the meantime, I then observed to the young
merchant, I am in every way your friend and servant; it were well that
your handsome mistress, to whom your heart is attached, should honour
us with her presence; it will be perfectly agreeable to me, and if you
please, I will send a person to call her. On hearing this, he was
extremely pleased, and said, &ldquo;Very well, my dear friend, yon have
[by your kind offer] spoken the wish of my heart.&rdquo; I sent a
eunuch [to bring her]. When half the night was past, that foul hag,
mounted on an elegant <i>chaudol,</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2521src" href="#xd26e2521" name="xd26e2521src">66</a> arrived
like an unexpected evil.</p>
<p>To please my guest I was compelled to advance, and receive her with
the utmost kindness, and place her near the young man. On seeing her,
he became as rejoiced as if he had received all the delights of the
world. That hag also clung round the neck of that angelic youth. The
[ludicrous] sight appeared, in plain truth, such as when over the moon
of the fourteenth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2529" href=
"#xd26e2529" name="xd26e2529">60</a>]</span>night, an eclipse comes. As
many people as were in the assembly began to put their fore-fingers
between their teeth,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2531src" href=
"#xd26e2531" name="xd26e2531src">67</a> saying [to themselves]
&ldquo;How could such a hag subdue the affections of this young
man!&rdquo; The eyes of all were turned in that direction. Disregarding
the amusements of the entertainment, they began to attend only to this
strange spectacle. Some apart observed, &ldquo;O friends, there is an
antagonism between love and reason! what judgment cannot conceive, this
cursed love will show. You must behold <i>Lail&#299;</i> with the eyes
of <i>M&#257;jn&#363;n.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2539src" href=
"#xd26e2539" name="xd26e2539src">68</a> All present exclaimed,
&ldquo;Very true, that is the fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the directions of the lady, I devoted myself to
attending on my guests; and although the young merchant pressed me to
eat and drink equally with himself, yet I refrained from fear of the
fair [one&rsquo;s displeasure], and did not give myself up to eating
and drinking, or the pleasures of the entertainment. I pleaded the
duties of hospitality as my excuse for not joining him [in the good
cheer]. In this scene of festivity three nights and days passed away.
On the fourth night,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2565src" href=
"#xd26e2565" name="xd26e2565src">69</a> the young merchant said to me
with extreme fondness, &ldquo;I now beg to take my leave; for your good
sake I have utterly neglected my affairs these three days, and have
attended you. Pray do you also sit near me for a moment, and rejoice my
heart,&rdquo; I in my own heart imagined that &ldquo;if I do
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2571" href="#xd26e2571" name=
"xd26e2571">61</a>]</span>not comply with his request at this moment,
then he will be grieved; and it is necessary I should please my new
friend and guest;&rdquo; on which account I replied, &ldquo;it is a
pleasure to me to obey the command of your honour;&rdquo; for &ldquo;a
command is paramount to ceremony&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2573src" href="#xd26e2573" name="xd26e2573src">70</a>. On hearing
this, the young merchant presented me a cup of wine, and I drank it
off; then the cup moved in such quick successive rounds, that in a
short time all the guests in the assembly became inebriated and
stupefied; I also became senseless.</p>
<p>When the morning came, and the sun had risen the height of two
spears,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2578src" href="#xd26e2578" name=
"xd26e2578src">71</a> my eyes opened, but I saw nothing of the
preparations, the assembly, or the beautiful lady&mdash;only the empty
house remained&mdash;but in a corner [of the hall] something lay folded
up in a blanket; I unfolded it, and saw the corpses of the young
merchant and of his [black] woman, with their heads severed from their
bodies. On seeing this sight, my senses forsook me, and my judgment was
of no avail [in explaining to me] what this was and what had happened.
I was staring about me, in every direction with amazement, when I
perceived a eunuch (whom I had seen in the preparations of the
entertainment). I was somewhat comforted on seeing him, and asked him
an explanation of these strange events. He replied briefly, &ldquo;What
good will it do thee to hear an explanation of what has happened, that
thou askest it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I also reflected in my mind, that what he said was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2586" href="#xd26e2586" name=
"xd26e2586">62</a>]</span>true; however, after a short pause, I said to
the eunuch, well, do not tell it to me; but inform me in what apartment
is the beloved lady. He answered, &ldquo;Certainly; whatever I know I
will relate to thee; but [I am surprised] that a man like thee,
possessed of understanding, should, without her ladyship&rsquo;s
permission, and without fear or ceremony, have indulged in a
wine-drinking party after an intimacy of only a few days.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2588src" href="#xd26e2588" name=
"xd26e2588src">72</a> What does all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I became much ashamed of my folly [and felt the justice] of the
eunuch&rsquo;s reprobation. I could make no other reply than to say,
&ldquo;indeed I have been guilty, pardon me.&rdquo; At last the eunuch,
becoming gracious, pointed out the beloved lady&rsquo;s abode, and took
his leave; he himself went to bury the two beheaded bodies. I was free
from any participation in that crime, and was anxious to meet the
beautiful lady. After a painful and difficult search, I arrived at
eventide in that street, [where she then was] according to (the
eunuch&rsquo;s) direction; and in a corner near the door I passed the
whole night in a state of agitation. I did not hear the sound of any
person&rsquo;s footsteps, nor did any one ask me about my affairs. In
this forlorn state the morning came; when the sun rose, the lovely fair
one looked at me from a window in the balcony of the house. My heart
only knows the state of joy I felt at that moment. I praised the
goodness of God.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, an eunuch came up to me, and said, &ldquo;Go and
stay in this [adjoining] mosque; perhaps <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2596" href="#xd26e2596" name="xd26e2596">63</a>]</span>your
wishes may, in that place, be accomplished, and you may yet gain the
desires of your heart.&rdquo; According to his advice I got up from the
place [where I had passed the night], and went to the mosque; but my
eyes remained fixed in the direction of the door of the house, to see
what might appear from behind the curtain of futurity. 1 waited for the
arrival of evening with the anxiety of a person who keeps the fast [of
<i>Ramaz&#804;an</i>].<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2601src" href=
"#xd26e2601" name="xd26e2601src">73</a> At last the evening came, and
the heavy day was removed from my heart. All at once the same eunuch
who had given me the directions to find out the lady&rsquo;s house,
came to the mosque. After finishing the evening prayer, having come up
to me, that obliging person, who was in all my secrets, gave me much
comfort, and taking me by the hand, led me along with him, proceeding
onwards at last having made me sit down in a small garden, he said:
&ldquo;Stay here until your desire [of seeing your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2629" href="#xd26e2629" name=
"xd26e2629">64</a>]</span>mistress] be accomplished.&rdquo; Then he
himself having taken his leave, went, perhaps, to impart my wishes to
the beautiful lady. I amused myself with admiring the beauty of the
flowers of the garden, and the brightness of the full moon, and the
play of the fountains in the canals and rivulets, a display like that
of the mouths of <i>S&#257;wan</i> and <i>Bh&#257;do&#7749;</i>; but
when I beheld the roses, I thought of the beautiful rose-like angel,
and when I gazed on the bright moon, I recollected her moon-like face.
All these delightful scenes without her were so many thorns in my
eyes.</p>
<p>At last God made her heart favourable to me. After a little while
that lovely fair one entered from the [garden] door adorned like the
full moon, wearing a rich dress, enriched with pearls, and covered from
head to feet with an embroidered veil; she stepped along the garden
walk, and stood [at a little distance from me]. By her coming, the
beauties of that garden, and the joy of my heart revived. After
strolling for a few minutes about the garden, she sat down in the
alcove on a richly-embroidered <i>masnad</i>. I ran, and like the moth
that flutters around the candle, offered my life as a sacrifice to her,
and like a slave stood before her with folded arms. At this moment the
eunuch appeared, and began to plead for my pardon and restoration to
her favour. Addressing myself to him, I said, I am guilty, and
culpable; whatever punishment is fixed on me, let it be executed. The
lady, though she was displeased, said with <i>hauteur</i>, &ldquo;The
best thing that can be done for him now is that he should receive a
hundred bags of gold pieces, and having <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2646" href="#xd26e2646" name="xd26e2646">65</a>]</span>got his
property all right, let him return to his native country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, I became a block of withered wood; if any
one had cut my body, not a drop of blood would have issued; all the
world began to appear dark before my sight; a sigh of despair burst
involuntarily from my heart, and the tears flowed from my eyes. I had
at that time no hope from any one except God; driven to utter despair,
I ventured to say, &ldquo;Well, [cruel fair,] reflect a moment, that if
to this unfortunate wretch there had been a desire for worldly wealth,
he would not have devoted his life and property to you. Are the
acknowledgments due to my services, and my having devoted my life to
you, flown all of a sudden from this world, that you have shown such
disfavour to a wretch like me? It is all well; to me life is no longer
of any use; to the helpless, half-dead lover there is no resource
against the faithlessness of the beloved one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, she was greatly offended, and frowning with
anger, she exclaimed, &ldquo;Very fine indeed! What, thou art my lover!
Has the frog then caught cold?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2652src"
href="#xd26e2652" name="xd26e2652src">74</a> O fool, for one in thy
situation to talk thus is an idle fancy; little mouths should not utter
big words: no more&mdash;be silent&mdash;repeat not such presumptuous
language; if any other had dared to behave so improperly, I vow to God,
I would have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2655" href="#xd26e2655"
name="xd26e2655">66</a>]</span>ordered his body to be cut in pieces,
and given to the kites [of the air]; but what can I do?&mdash;Your
services ever come to my recollection. Thou hadst best now take the
road [to thy home;] thy fate had decreed thee food and drink only until
now in my house!&rdquo; I then weeping, said, if it has been written in
my destiny that I am not to attain the desires of my heart, but to
wander miserably through woods and over mountains, then I have no
remedy left. On hearing these words, she became vexed and said,
&ldquo;These hints and this flattering nonsense are not agreeable to
me; go and repeat them to those who are fit to hear them.&rdquo; Then
getting up in the same angry mood, she returned to her house. I
beseeched her to hear me, but she disregarded what I said. Having no
resource, I likewise left the place, sad and hopeless.</p>
<p>In short, for forty days this same state of things continued. When I
was tired of pacing the lanes of the city, I wandered into the woods,
and when I became restless there, I returned to the lanes of the city
like a lunatic. I thought not of nourishment during the day, or sleep
at night; like a washerman&rsquo;s dog, that belongs neither to the
house nor the <i>gh&#257;t</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2661src"
href="#xd26e2661" name="xd26e2661src">75</a> The existence of man
depends on eating and drinking; he is the worm of the grain. Not the
least strength remained in my body. Becoming feeble, I went and lay
down under the wall of the same mosque; when one day <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2667" href="#xd26e2667" name=
"xd26e2667">67</a>]</span>the eunuch aforementioned came there to say
his Friday prayers, and passed near me; I was repeating at the time,
slow from weakness, this verse:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Give me strength of mind to bear these pangs of
the heart, or give me death;</p>
<p class="line">Whatever may have been written in my destiny, O God!
let it come soon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Though in appearance my looks were greatly altered,
and my face was such that whoever had seen me formerly would not have
recognised me to be the same person; yet the eunuch, hearing the sounds
of grief, looked at me, and regarding me with attention, pitied me, and
with much kindness addressed me, saying, &ldquo;At last to this State
thou hast brought thyself.&rdquo; I replied, what was to occur has now
happened; I devoted my property to her welfare, and I have sacrificed
my life likewise; such has been her pleasure; then what shall I do?</p>
<p>On hearing this, he left a servant with me, and went into the
mosque; when he finished his prayers, and [heard] the
<i>K&#863;hut&#804;ba</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2681src" href=
"#xd26e2681" name="xd26e2681src">76</a> he returned to me, and putting
me into a <i>miy&#257;na</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2695src" href=
"#xd26e2695" name="xd26e2695src">77</a> had me carried along to the
house of that indifferent fair, and placed me outside the
<i>chi&#7731;</i> [of her apartment]. Though no trace of my former self
remained, yet as I had been for a long while constantly with the lovely
fair one, [she must have recognised me]; however, though knowing me
perfectly, she acted as a stranger, and asked the eunuch who I
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2704" href="#xd26e2704" name=
"xd26e2704">68</a>]</span>was. That excellent man replied, &ldquo;This
is that unfortunate, ill-fated wretch who has fallen under the
displeasure and reprehension of your highness; for this reason his
appearance is such; he is burning with the fire of love; how much
soever he endeavours to quench the flame with the water of tears, yet
it burns with double force. Nothing is of the least avail; moreover he
is dying with the shame of his fault.&rdquo; The fair lady jocosely
said, &ldquo;Why dost thou tell lies? I received from my
intelligencers,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2707src" href="#xd26e2707"
name="xd26e2707src">78</a> many days ago, the news of his arrival in
his own country; God knows who this is of whom you speak.&rdquo; Then
the eunuch, putting his hands together, said, &ldquo;If security be
granted to my life,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2713src" href=
"#xd26e2713" name="xd26e2713src">79</a> then I will be so bold as to
address your highness.&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;Speak; your life is
secure.&rdquo; The eunuch said, &ldquo;Your highness is by nature a
judge of merit; for God&rsquo;s sake lift up the screen from between
you, and recognise him, and take pity on his lamentable condition.
Ingratitude is not proper. Now whatever compassion you may feel for his
present condition is amiable and meritorious&mdash;to say more would be
[to outstep] the bounds of respect; whatever your highness ordains,
that assuredly is best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this speech [of the eunuch], she smiled and said,
&ldquo;Well, let him be who he will, keep him in the hospital; when he
gets well, then his situation shall <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2718" href="#xd26e2718" name="xd26e2718">69</a>]</span>be
inquired into.&rdquo; The eunuch answered, &ldquo;If you will
condescend to sprinkle rose-water on him with your own royal hands, and
say a kind word to him, then there may be hopes of his living; despair
is a bad thing; the world exists through hope.&rdquo; Even on this, the
fair one said nothing [to console me]. Hearing this dialogue, I also
continued becoming more and more tired of existence. I fearlessly said,
&ldquo;I do not wish to live any longer on these terms; my feet are
hanging in the grave, and I must soon die; my remedy is in the power of
your highness; whether you may apply it or not, that you only
know.&rdquo; At last the Almighty<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2720src"
href="#xd26e2720" name="xd26e2720src">80</a> softened the heart of that
stony-hearted one; she became gracious and said, &ldquo;Send
immediately for the royal physicians.&rdquo; In a short time they came
and assembled [around me]; they felt my pulse and examined my urine
with much deliberation; at last it was settled in their
pr&aelig;gnosis, that &ldquo;this person is in love with some one;
except the being united with the beloved object, there is no other
cure; whenever he possesses her he will be well.&rdquo; When from the
declaration of the physicians my complaint was thus confirmed, the fair
lady said, &ldquo;Carry this young man to the warm bath, and after
bathing him and dressing him in fine clothes, bring him to me.&rdquo;
They instantly carried me out, and after bathing me and clothing me
well, they led me before the lovely angel; then that beautiful creature
said with kindness, &ldquo;Thou hast constantly, and for nothing, got
me censured and dishonoured; now what more dost thou wish? Whatever is
in thy heart, speak it out quite plainly?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2723" href="#xd26e2723" name=
"xd26e2723">70</a>]</span></p>
<p>O, <i>Darweshes!</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2728src" href=
"#xd26e2728" name="xd26e2728src">81</a> at that moment my emotions were
such that [I thought] I should have died with joy, and swelled so
greatly with pleasure, that my <i>j&#257;ma</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2736src" href="#xd26e2736" name="xd26e2736src">82</a> could
hardly contain me, and my countenance and appearance became changed; I
praised God, and said to her, this moment all the art of physic is
centered in you, who have restored a corpse like me to life with a
single word; behold, from that time to this, what a change has taken
place in my circumstances [by the kindness you have shewn].&rdquo;
After saying this, I went round her three times,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2742src" href="#xd26e2742" name="xd26e2742src">83</a> and
standing before her, I said, &ldquo;your commands are that I should
speak whatever I have in my heart; this boon is more precious to your
slave than the empire of the seven climes; then be generous and accept
this wretch! keep me at your feet and elevate me,&rdquo; On hearing
this ejaculation, she became thoughtful for a moment; then regarding me
askance, she said, &ldquo;Sit down; your services and fidelity have
been such that whatever you say becomes you; they are also engraven on
my heart. Well; I comply with your request.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same day, in a happy hour, and under a propitious star the
<i>&#7731;&#257;z&#803;&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2750src"
href="#xd26e2750" name="xd26e2750src">84</a> quite privately performed
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2765" href="#xd26e2765" name=
"xd26e2765">71</a>]</span>marriage rites. After so much trouble and
afflictions, God shewed me this happy day, when I gained the desires of
my heart; but in the same degree that my heart wished to possess this
angelic lady, it felt equally anxious and uneasy to know the
explication of those strange events [which had occurred]; for, up to
that day I knew nothing about who she was; or who was that brown,
handsome negro, who on seeing a bit of paper, delivered to me so many
bags of gold; and how that princely entertainment was prepared in the
space of one <i>pahar</i>; and why those two innocent persons were put
to death after the entertainment; and the cause of the anger and
ingratitude she showed me after all my services and kindnesses; and
then all at once to elevate this wretch [to the height of happiness.].
In short, I was so anxious to develop these strange circumstances and
doubts, that for eight days after the marriage ceremonies,
notwithstanding my great affection for her, I did not attempt to
consummate the rites of wedlock. I merely slept with her at night, and
got up in the morning &ldquo;re non effect&acirc;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One morning I desired an attendant to prepare some warm water in
order that I might bathe.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2772src" href=
"#xd26e2772" name="xd26e2772src">85</a> The princess smiling, said,
&ldquo;Where is the necessity for the hot water?&rdquo; I remained
silent; but she was perplexed [to account] for my conduct; moreover, in
her looks the signs of anger were visible; so much so, that she one day
said to me, &ldquo;Thou art indeed a strange man; at one time so warm
before, and now so cold! what do people call this [conduct]? If you had
not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2781" href="#xd26e2781" name=
"xd26e2781">72</a>]</span>manly vigour, then why did you form so
foolish a wish? I then having become fearless, replied, &ldquo;O, my
darling, justice is a positive duty; no person ought to deviate from
the rules of justice. She replied, &ldquo;What further justice remains
[to be done]? whatever was to happen has taken place.&rdquo; I
answered, in truth, that which was my most earnest wish and desire I
have gained; but, my heart is uneasy with doubts, and the man whose
mind is filled with suspicions is ever perplexed; he can do nothing,
and becomes different from other human creatures. I had determined
within myself that after this marriage, which is my soul&rsquo;s entire
delight, I would question your highness respecting sundry circumstances
which I do not comprehend, and which I cannot unravel; that from your
own blessed lips I might hear their explanation; then my heart would be
at ease.&rdquo; The lovely lady frowning, said, &ldquo;How pretty! you
have already forgotten [what I told you]; recollect, many times I have
desired you not to search into my concerns, or to oppose what I say;
and is it proper in you to take, contrary to custom, such
liberties?&rdquo; I laughing replied, as you have pardoned me much
greater liberties, forgive this also. That angelic fair, changing her
looks and getting warm, became a whirlwind of fire, and said;
&ldquo;You presume too much; go and mind your own affairs; what
advantage can you derive from [the explanation of] these
circumstances?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;the greatest shame in this
world is the exposure of our person; but we are conversant with one
another [in that respect], hence as you have thought it right to lay
aside this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2783" href="#xd26e2783"
name="xd26e2783">73</a>]</span>repugnance with me, then why conceal any
other secrets from me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her good sense made her comprehend my hint, and she said,
&ldquo;This is true; but I am very apprehensive if I, wretched, should
divulge my secrets; it may be the cause of great trouble.&rdquo; I
answered, what strange apprehensions you form! do not conceive in your
heart such an idea of me, and relate without restraint all the events
of your life; never, never, shall they pass from my breast to my lips;
what possibility, then, of their reaching the ear of another?&rdquo;
When she perceived that, without satisfying my curiosity she should
have no rest, being without resource, she said, &ldquo;Many evils
attend the explanation of these matters, but you are obstinately bent
upon it. Well, I must please you; for which reason I am going to relate
the events of my past life&mdash;take care; it is equally necessary for
you to conceal them [from the world]; my information is on this
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, after many injunctions, she began the relation [of her
life] as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;The unfortunate wretch before you is the
daughter of the King of Damascus; he is a great sovereign among
sultans; he never had any child except me. From the day I was born I
was brought up with great delicacy and tenderness, in joy and happiness
under the eye of my father and mother. As I grew up I became attached
to handsome and beautiful women; so that I kept near my person the most
lovely young girls of noble families, and of my own age; and handsome
female servants of the like age, in my service. I ever enjoyed the
amusements of dancing and singing, and never had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2789" href="#xd26e2789" name=
"xd26e2789">74</a>]</span>a care about the good or evil of the world.
Contemplating my own condition thus free from care, except the praises
of God, nothing else occupied my thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so happened that my disposition became suddenly of itself
so changed, that I lost all relish for the company of others, nor did
the gay assembly afford me any pleasure; my temper became melancholic,
and my heart sad and confused; no one&rsquo;s presence was agreeable to
me, nor did my heart feel inclined for conversation. Seeing this sad
condition of mine, all the female servants were overwhelmed with sorrow
and fell at my feet [begging to know the cause of my gloom]. This
faithful eunuch, who has long been in my secrets, and from whom no
action of my life is concealed, seeing my melancholy, said, &lsquo;If
the princess would drink a little of the exhilarating
lemonade,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2793src" href="#xd26e2793" name=
"xd26e2793src">86</a> it is most probable that her cheerful disposition
would be restored; and gladness return to her heart.&rsquo; On hearing
him say so, I had a desire [to taste it], and ordered some to be
prepared immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eunuch went out [to make it up], and returned,
accompanied by a young boy, who brought a goblet of the lemonade,
carefully prepared and cooled in ice. I drank it, and perceived it
produced the good effect ascribed to it; for this piece of service I
bestowed on the eunuch a rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2810src" href="#xd26e2810" name=
"xd26e2810src">87</a> and desired him to bring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2816" href="#xd26e2816" name=
"xd26e2816">75</a>]</span>me a goblet of the same every day at the same
hour. From that day it became a regular duty, that the eunuch came,
accompanied by the boy who brought the lemonade, and I drank it. When
its inebriating quality took effect, I used in the elevation of my
spirits to jest and laugh with the boy, and beguile my time. When his
timidity wore off, he began to utter very agreeable speeches, and
related many pleasant anecdotes; moreover, he began to heave sighs and
sobs. His face was handsome and worth seeing; I began to like him
beyond control. I, from the affections of my heart, and the relish I
felt for his playful humour, every day gave him rewards and gratuities;
but the wretch always appeared before me in the same clothes that he
had been accustomed to wear, and they even were dirty and soiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I said to him, you have received a good deal [of
money] from the treasury, but your appearance is as wretched as ever;
what is the cause of it? have you spent the money, or do you amass
it?<span class="corr" id="xd26e2820" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> When the boy heard these encouraging
words, and found that I enquired into his condition, he said with tears
in his eyes, &lsquo;Whatever you have bestowed on this slave, my
preceptor has taken from me; he did not give me one
<i>pais&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2825src" href="#xd26e2825"
name="xd26e2825src">88</a> for myself; with what shall I make up other
clothes, and appear better dressed before you? it is not my fault, and
I cannot help it.&rsquo; At this humble statement of his, I felt pity
for him; I instantly ordered the eunuch to take charge of the boy from
that day, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2831" href="#xd26e2831"
name="xd26e2831">76</a>]</span>to educate him under his own eye, and
give him good clothes, and not to allow him to play and skip about with
other boys; moreover, that my wish was, he should be taught a
respectful mode of behaviour, to fit him for my own princely service,
and to wait on me. The eunuch obeyed my orders, and perceiving how my
inclinations leaned, he took the utmost care of him. In a little time,
from ease and good living, his colour and sleekness changed greatly,
like a snake&rsquo;s throwing off its slough; I restrained my
inclinations as much as I could, but the [handsome] form of that
rogue<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2833src" href="#xd26e2833" name=
"xd26e2833src">89</a> was so engraven on my heart, that I fondly wished
to keep him clasped to my bosom, and never take my eyes off him for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, I made him enter into my companionship, and dressing
him in a variety of rich clothes and all kinds of jewels, I used to
gaze at him. In short, by being always with me, my longing eyes were
satisfied and my heart comforted; I every moment complied with his
wants and wishes; at last, my condition was such, that if on any urgent
occasion he was absent for a moment from my sight, I became quite
uneasy. In a few years he became a youth, and the down appeared on his
cheeks; his body and limbs were well formed! then there began to be a
talk about him out of doors among the courtiers. The guards of all
descriptions began to forbid him from coming and going within the
palace. At length, his entrance into it was quite stopped, and without
him I had no rest; a moment <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2841"
href="#xd26e2841" name="xd26e2841">77</a>]</span>[of absence on his
part,] was an age [of pain on mine]. When I heard these tidings of
despair, I was as distracted as if the day of judgment had burst over
me; and such was my condition that I could not speak a word [to express
my wishes]: nor yet could I live separated from him. I had no means of
relief; O God, what could I do; a strange kind of uneasiness came over
me, and in consequence of my distraction I addressed myself to the same
eunuch [who was in all my secrets], and said to him, &lsquo;I wish to
take care of this youth. In fact, the best plan is for you to give him
a thousand gold pieces, to set him up in a jeweller&rsquo;s shop in the
<i>chauk</i>, that he may from the profit of his trade live
comfortably; and to build him a handsome house near my residence; to
buy him slaves, and hire him servants and fix their pay, that he may in
every way live at his ease.&rsquo; The eunuch furnished him with a
house, and set up a jeweller&rsquo;s shop for him to carry on the
traffic, and prepared everything that was requisite. In a short time,
his shop became so brilliant and showy, that whatever rich
<i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;ats</i> or superb jewels were required for the king
and his nobles, could only be procured there; and by degrees his shop
so flourished, that all the rarities of every country were to be found
there; and the daily traffic of all other jewellers became languid in
comparison with his. In short, no one was able to compete with him in
the city, nor was his equal [to be found] in any other country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He made a great deal of money<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2851src" href="#xd26e2851" name="xd26e2851src">90</a> by his
business; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2881" href="#xd26e2881"
name="xd26e2881">78</a>]</span>but [grief for his] absence daily preyed
on my mind, and injured my health; no expedient could be hit upon by
which I might see him, and console my heart. At last, for the purpose
of consultation, I sent for the same experienced eunuch, and said to
him, &lsquo;I can devise no plan by which I may see the youth for a
moment, and inspire my heart with patience. There remains only this
method, which is to dig a mine from his house and join the same to the
palace.&rsquo; I had no sooner expressed my wish, than such a mine was
dug in a few days, so that on the approach of evening the eunuch used
to conduct the young man through that same passage, in silence and
secrecy [to my apartment]. We used to pass the whole night in eating
and drinking, and every enjoyment; I was delighted to meet him, and he
was rejoiced to see me. When the morning star appeared, and the
<i>muwaz&#817;z&#817;in</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2885src" href=
"#xd26e2885" name="xd26e2885src">91</a> gave notice [of the time for
morning prayers], the eunuch used to lead the youth by the same way to
his house. No fourth person had any knowledge of these circumstances;
[it was known] only to the eunuch and two nurses who had given me milk,
and brought me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long period passed in this manner; but it happened one day
that when the eunuch went to call him, according to custom, then he
perceived that the youth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2893" href=
"#xd26e2893" name="xd26e2893">79</a>]</span>was sitting sorrowful and
silent. The eunuch asked him, &lsquo;Is all well to-day? why are you so
sad? Come to the princess; she has sent for you.&rsquo; The youth made
no reply whatever, nor did he move his tongue. The eunuch returned
alone with a similar face, and mentioned to me the young man&rsquo;s
condition. As the devil was about to ruin me, even after this conduct I
could not banish him from my heart; if I had known that my love and
affection for such an ungrateful wretch would have at last rendered me
infamous and degraded, and would have destroyed my fame and honour;
then I should have at that moment shrunk back from such a proceeding,
and should have done penance; I never again should have pronounced his
name, neither should I have devoted my heart to the shameless [fellow].
But it was to happen so; for this reason I took no heed of his improper
conduct, and his not coming I imagined to be the affectation and airs
of those [who are conscious of being] beloved; its consequences I have
sadly rued, and thou art now also informed of these events without
hearing or seeing them; or else where were you, and where was I? Well,
what has happened is past. Bestowing not a thought on the conceited
airs of that ass, I again sent him word by the eunuch, saying,
&lsquo;if thou wilt not come to me now, by some means or other I will
come to thee; but there is much impropriety in my coming
there;&mdash;if this secret is discovered, thou wilt have cause to rue
it; so do not act in a manner that will have no other result than
disgrace; it is best that thou comest quickly [to me], otherwise
imagine me arrived [near thee]. When he received this message,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2895" href="#xd26e2895" name=
"xd26e2895">80</a>]</span>and perceived that my love for him was
unbounded, he came with disagreeable looks and affected airs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he sat down by me, I asked him, &lsquo;what is the cause
of your coolness and anger to-day; you never showed so much insolence
and disrespect before, you always used to come without making any
excuses.&rsquo; To this he replied, &lsquo;I am a poor nameless wretch;
by your favour, and owing to you, I am arrived to such power, and with
much ease and affluence I pass my days. I ever pray for your life and
prosperity; I have committed this fault in full reliance on your
highness&rsquo;s forgiveness, and I hope for pardon. As I loved him
from my soul and heart, I accepted his well-turned apology, and not
only overlooked his knavery, but even asked him again with affection,
what great difficulty has occurred that you are so thoughtful? mention
it, and it shall be instantly removed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, in his humble way, he replied, &lsquo;Everything is
difficult to me; before your highness, all is easy,&rsquo; At last,
from the purport of his discourse and conversation, it appeared that an
elegant garden, with a grand house in it, together with reservoirs,
tanks and wells, of finished masonry, was for sale, situated in the
centre of the city and near his house; and that with the garden a
female slave was to be sold, who sung admirably and understood music
perfectly. But they were to be sold together, and not the garden alone,
&lsquo;like the cat tied to the camel&rsquo;s neck;&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2902src" href="#xd26e2902" name=
"xd26e2902src">92</a> and that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2916"
href="#xd26e2916" name="xd26e2916">81</a>]</span>whoever purchased the
garden must also buy the slave; the best of it was, the price of the
garden was five thousand rupees, and the price of the slave five
hundred thousand. [He concluded saying], &lsquo;Your devoted slave
cannot at present raise so large a sum.&rsquo; I perceived that his
heart was greatly bent on buying them, and that for this reason he was
thoughtful, and embarrassed in mind; although he was seated near me,
yet his looks were pensive and his heart sad: as his happiness every
hour and moment was dear to me, I that instant ordered the eunuch to go
in the morning and settle the price of the garden and the slave, get
their bills of sale drawn up, and deliver them to this person, and pay
the price to their owner from the royal treasury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing this order, the young man thanked me, tears of joy
came upon his face; and we passed the night as usual in laughing and
delight; in the morning he took leave. The eunuch, agreeably to my
orders, bought and delivered over to him the garden and the slave. The
youth continued his visits at night, according to custom [and retired
in the morning]. One day in the season of spring, when the whole place
was indeed charming, the clouds were gathering low, and the rain
drizzling fell, the lightning also continued to flash [through the
murky clouds], and the breeze played gently [through the
trees]&mdash;in short, it was a delightful scene. When in the
<i>t&#804;&#257;&#7731;s</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2922src" href=
"#xd26e2922" name="xd26e2922src">93</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2927" href="#xd26e2927" name="xd26e2927">82</a>]</span>the
liquors of various colours, arranged in elegant phials, fell upon my
sight; my heart longed to take a draught. After I had drank two or
three cupfulls, instantly the idea of the newly purchased garden struck
me. An irrepressible desire arose within me, when in that state, that
for a short time I should enjoy a walk in that [garden]. When the
stream of misfortune flows against us, we struggle in vain against the
tide.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2929src" href="#xd26e2929" name=
"xd26e2929src">94</a> I involuntarily took a female servant with me,
and went to the young man&rsquo;s house by the way of the mine; from
thence I proceeded to the garden, and saw that the delightful place was
in truth equal to the Elysian fields. As the raindrops fell on the
fresh green leaves of the trees, one might say they were like pearls
set in pieces of emerald, and the carnation of the flowers, in that
cloudy day, appeared as beautiful as the ruddy crepuscle after the
setting sun; the basons and canals, full of water, seemed like sheets
of mirrors, over which the small waves undulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, I was strolling about in every direction in that
garden, when the day vanished and the darkness of night became
conspicuous. At that moment, the young man appeared on a walk [in the
garden]; and on seeing me, he approached with respect and great warmth
of affection, and taking my hand in his, led me to the
pavilion.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2934src" href="#xd26e2934" name=
"xd26e2934src">95</a> On entering it, the splendour of the scene made
me entirely forget all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2943"
href="#xd26e2943" name="xd26e2943">83</a>]</span>beauty of the garden.
The illuminations within were magnificent; on every side, gerandoles,
in the shape of cypresses, and various kinds of lights in variegated
lamps were lighted up; even the <i>shabi bar&#257;t</i>, with all its
moonlight and its illuminations, would appear dark [in comparison to
the brightness which shone in the pavilion]; on one side,
fire-works<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2948src" href="#xd26e2948" name=
"xd26e2948src">96</a> of every description were displayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, the clouds dispersed, and the bright moon
appeared like a lovely mistress clothed in a lilac-coloured robe, who
suddenly strikes our sight. It was a scene of great beauty; as the moon
burst forth, the young man said, &lsquo;Let us now go and sit in the
balcony which overlooks the garden.&rsquo; I had become so infatuated,
that whatever the wretch proposed I implicitly obeyed; now he led me
such a dance, that he dragged me up [to the balcony.] That building was
so high, that all the houses of the city and the lights of the
<i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i>, appeared as if they were at the foot of it. I
was seated in a state of delight, with my arms round the youth&rsquo;s
neck; meanwhile, a woman, quite ugly, without form or shape, entered as
it were from the chimney, with a bottle of wine in her hand; I was at
that time greatly displeased at her sudden entrance, and on seeing her
looks, my heart became alarmed. Then, in confusion, I asked the young
man, &lsquo;who is this precious hag; from whence have you grubbed her
up?&rsquo; Joining his hands together, he replied, &lsquo;This is the
slave who was bought with the garden through your generous
assistance.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2956" href=
"#xd26e2956" name="xd26e2956">84</a>]</span>I had perceived that the
simpleton had bought her with much eager desire, and perhaps his heart
was fixed on her; for this reason, I, suppressing my inward vexation,
remained silent; but my heart from that moment was disturbed and
displeasure affected my temper; moreover, the wretch had the impudence
to make this harlot our cup-bearer. At that moment I was drinking my
own blood with rage, and was as uneasy as a parrot shut up in the same
cage with a crow: I had no opportunity of going away, and did not wish
to stay. To shorten the story, the wine was of the strongest
description, so that on drinking it a man would become a beast. She
plied the young man with two or three cups in succession of that fiery
liquor, and I also bitterly swallowed half a cupfull at the importunity
of the youth; at last, the shameless harlot likewise got beastly drunk,
and took very unbecoming liberties with that vile youth; and the mean
wretch also, in his intoxication, having become regardless, began to be
disrespectful, and behave indecently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so much ashamed, that had the earth opened at the
moment I would have willingly jumped into it; but in consequence of my
passion for him, I, infatuated, even after all these circumstances,
remained silent. However, he was completely a vile wretch, and did not
feel the value of my forbearance. In the fervour of intoxication, he
drank off two cups more, so that his little remaining sense vanished,
and he completely drove from his heart all respect for me. Without
shame, and in the rage of lust, the barefaced villain consummated
before me his career of infamous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2960" href="#xd26e2960" name="xd26e2960">85</a>]</span>indecency
with his hideous mistress, who, in that posture, began to play off all
the blandishments of love, and kissing and embracing took place between
the two. In that faithless man no sense of honour remained; neither did
modesty exist in that shameless woman; &lsquo;As the soul is, so are
the angels.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2962src" href=
"#xd26e2962" name="xd26e2962src">97</a> My state [of mind] at the time
was like that of a songstress who having [lost the musical time,] sings
out of tune. I was invoking curses on myself for having come there,
saying that I was properly punished for my folly. At last, how could I
bear it? I was on fire from head to foot, and began to roll on live
coals. In my rage and wrath I recollected the proverb, that &lsquo;It
is not the bullock that leaps, but the sack;<a id="xd26e2968" name=
"xd26e2968"></a><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2969src" href="#xd26e2969"
name="xd26e2969src">98</a> whoever has seen a sight like this?&rsquo;
in saying this to myself, I came away thence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That drunkard in the depravity of his heart thought, if I was
offended now, what then would be his treatment the next day, and what a
commotion I should raise. So he imagined it best to finish my existence
[whilst he had me in his power.] Having formed this resolution in his
mind with the advice of the hag, he put his
<i>pa&#7789;k&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e2976src" href=
"#xd26e2976" name="xd26e2976src">99</a> round his neck and fell at my
feet, and taking off his turban from his head, began to supplicate [my
forgiveness] in the humblest manner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2991" href="#xd26e2991" name="xd26e2991">86</a>]</span>My heart
was infatuated towards him; whithersoever he turned I turned; and like
the handmill I was entirely under his control. I implicitly complied
with all he desired; some way or other he pacified me, and persuaded me
to retake my seat. He again took two or three cupfulls of the fiery
liquor, and he induced me to drink some also. I, in the first place,
was already inflamed with rage, and secondly, after drinking such
strong liquor I soon became quite senseless&mdash;no recollection
remained. Then that unfeeling, ungrateful, cruel wretch wounded me with
his sword; yea, further, he thought he had completely killed me. At
that moment, my eyes opened, and I uttered these words, &lsquo;Well, as
I have acted, so I have been rewarded; but do thou screen thyself from
the consequences of shedding unjustly my blood. Let it not so happen
that some tyrant should seize thee; do thou wash off my blood from thy
garment; what has happened is past.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not divulge this secret to any one; I have not been
wanting to thee even with loss of life. Then placing him under the
protection of God&rsquo;s mercy, I fainted [from the loss of blood],
and knew nothing of what afterwards happened. Perhaps, that butcher,
conceiving me dead, put me into the chest, and let me down over the
walls of the fortress, the same as you yourself saw, I wished no one
ill; but these misfortunes were written in my destiny, and the lines of
fate cannot be effaced. My eyes have been the cause of all these
calamities: if I had not had a strong desire to behold beautiful
persons, then that wretch would not have been my bane.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2995src" href="#xd26e2995" name=
"xd26e2995src">100</a> God so ordained <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2998" href="#xd26e2998" name="xd26e2998">87</a>]</span>that He
made thee arrive there; and, He made thee the means of saving my life.
After undergoing these disgraces, I am ashamed to reflect that I should
yet live and show my face to any one. But what can I do? the choice of
death is not in our hands; God, after killing me, hath restored me to
life; let us see what is written in my future fate. In all appearance,
your exertions and zeal have been of use, so that I have been cured of
such wounds. Thou hast been ready to promote my wishes with thy life
and property, and whatever were thy means, thou hast offered [them
cheerfully]. In those days, seeing thee without money and sad, I wrote
the note to <i>S&#299;d&#299; Bah&#257;r</i>, who is my cashier. In
that note, I mentioned that I was in health and safety in such a place,
and I said, &ldquo;convey the intelligence of me unfortunate to my
excellent mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>S&#299;d&#299;</i> sent by thee those trays of gold
for my expenses; and when I sent thee to the shop of <i>Y&#363;suf</i>
the merchant, to purchase <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;ats</i> and jewels, I
felt confident that the weakminded wretch, who soon becomes friends
with every one, conceiving you a stranger, would certainly form an
intimacy with you, and indulging his conceit, invite you to a feast and
entertainment. This stratagem of mine turned out right, and he did
exactly what I had imagined in my heart. Then, when you promised him to
return, and came to me and related the particulars of his insisting
upon it, I was heartily pleased with the circumstance; for I knew that
if you went to his house, and there ate and drank, you would invite him
in return, and that he would eagerly come; for this reason, I sent thee
back <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3014" href="#xd26e3014" name=
"xd26e3014">88</a>]</span>quickly to him. After three days, when you
returned from the entertainment, and, quite abashed, made me many
apologies for staying away so long, to make you easy in your mind, I
replied, &lsquo;it is of no consequence; when he gave you leave then
you came away; but to be without delicacy is not proper, and we should
not bear another&rsquo;s debt of gratitude without an idea of paying
it; now do you go and invite him also, and bring him along with
you.&rsquo; When you went away to his house, I saw that no preparations
could be got ready for the entertainment at our house, and if he should
all at once come, what could I do? but it fortunately happened that
from time immemorial, the custom of this country has been for the kings
to remain out for eight months in the year, to settle the affairs of
the provinces, and collect the revenues, and for four months, during
the rains, to stay [in the city] in their auspicious palaces. In those
days, the king, this unfortunate wretch&rsquo;s father, had gone into
the provinces some two or four months previously to arrange the affairs
of the kingdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst you were gone to bring the young merchant [to the
entertainment], <i>S&#299;d&#299; Bah&#257;r</i> imparted the
particulars of my present situation to the queen (who is the mother of
me impure). Again I, ashamed of my guilty conduct, went to the queen
and related to her all that happened to me. Although she, from motherly
affection and good sense, had used every means to conceal the
circumstance of my disappearance, saying, &lsquo;God knows what may be
the end of it;&rsquo; she conceived it wrong to make public my disgrace
for the present, and for my sake she had concealed my errors
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3021" href="#xd26e3021" name=
"xd26e3021">89</a>]</span>in her maternal breast; but she had all along
been in search of me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she saw me in this condition, and heard all the
circumstances [of my misfortune], her eyes filled with tears, and she
said, &lsquo;O unfortunate wretch! thou hast knowingly destroyed the
honour and glory of the throne; a thousand pities that thou hadst not
perished also; if instead of thee I had been brought to bed of a stone,
I should have been patient; even now [it is not too late to] repent;
whatever was in thy unfortunate fate has happened; what wilt thou do
next? Wilt thou live or die?&rsquo; I replied, with excessive shame,
that in this worthless wretch&rsquo;s fate it was so written, that I
should live in such disgrace and distress after escaping such various
dangers; it would have been better to have perished; though the mark of
infamy is stamped on my forehead, yet I have not been guilty of such an
action as can disgrace my parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great pain I now feel is, that those base wretches should
escape my vengeance, and enjoy their crime in each other&rsquo;s
company, whilst I have suffered such affliction from their hands: it is
a pity that I can do nothing [in order to punish them]. I hope one
favour [from your majesty], that you would order your steward to
prepare all the necessary articles for an entertainment at my house,
that I may, under the pretence of an entertainment, send for those two
wretches, and punish them for their deeds and also inflict vengeance
for myself. In the same manner that he lifted his hand upon me and
wounded me, may I be enabled to cut them to pieces; then my heart will
be soothed; otherwise I must continue glowing in this fire of
resentment, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3027" href=
"#xd26e3027" name="xd26e3027">90</a>]</span>ultimately I must be burnt
to cinders. On hearing this speech, my excellent mother became kind
from maternal fondness, and concealed my guilt in her own breast, and
sent all the necessaries for the entertainment by the same eunuch who
is in my secrets. Every necessary attendant came also, and each was
ready in his own appropriate occupation. In the time of evening, you
brought the [base villain who is now dead]; I wished the harlot should
likewise come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason I earnestly desired you to send for her; when
she also came and the guests were assembled, they all became thoroughly
intoxicated and senseless by drinking largely of wine; you also got
drunk along with them, and lay like a corpse. I ordered a
<i>&#7730;ilm&#257;kin&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3034src"
href="#xd26e3034" name="xd26e3034src">101</a> to cut off both their
heads with a sword; she instantly drew her sword and cut off both their
heads, and dyed their bodies with their blood. The cause of my anger
towards thee was this, that I had given thee permission for the
entertainment, but not to become an associate in wine-drinking, with
people thou hadst only known for a few days. Assuredly this folly on
thy part was anything but pleasing to me; for when you drank till you
became senseless, then what hopes of aid from you remained? But the
claims of thy services so cling around my neck, that, notwithstanding
such conduct, I forgive thee. And now, behold, I have related to thee
all my adventures from the beginning to the end; do you yet desire in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3049" href="#xd26e3049" name=
"xd26e3049">91</a>]</span>your heart any other [explanations]? In the
same manner that I have, in compliance with your wishes, granted all
you requested, do you also in like manner perform what I desire; my
advice on this occasion is, that it is no longer proper either for you
or me to remain in this city. Henceforward you are master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O devoted to God!<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3053src" href=
"#xd26e3053" name="xd26e3053src">102</a> the princess having spoken
thus far, remained silent. I, who with heart and soul considered her
wishes paramount to everything, and was entangled in the net of her
affections, replied, &ldquo;whatever you advise, that is best, and I
will without hesitation carry the same into effect.&rdquo; When the
princess found me obedient, and her servant, she ordered two swift and
high-mettled horses (which might vie with the wind in speed), to be
brought from the royal stables, and kept in readiness. I went and
picked out just such beautiful and high spirited horses as she
required, and had them saddled and brought [to our house]. When a few
hours of the night remained, the princess put on men&rsquo;s clothes,
and arming herself with the five weapons,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3059src" href="#xd26e3059" name="xd26e3059src">103</a> mounted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3095" href="#xd26e3095" name=
"xd26e3095">92</a>]</span>on one of the horses; I got on the other,
completely armed, and we set out in the same direction.</p>
<p>When night was over, and the dawn began to appear, we arrived on the
banks of a certain lake; alighting from our horses, we washed our hands
and faces; having breakfasted in great haste, we mounted again and set
off. Now and then the princess spoke, and said, &ldquo;I have for your
sake left fame, honour, wealth, country and parents all behind me; now,
may it not so happen, that you also should behave to me like that
faithless savage.&rdquo; Sometimes I talked of different matters to
beguile the journey, and sometimes replied to her questions and doubts,
saying &ldquo;O princess, all men are not alike; there must have been
some defect in that base villain&rsquo;s parentage, that by him such a
deed was done; but I have sacrificed my wealth and devoted my life to
you, and you have dignified me in every way. I am now your slave
without purchase, and if you should make shoes of my skin and wear
them, I will not complain.&rdquo; Such conversation passed between us,
and day and night to travel onward was our business. If through fatigue
we sometimes dismounted somewhere, we then used to hunt down the beasts
and birds of the woods, and having lawfully slain them, and applied
salt from the salt-cellar, and having struck fire with steel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3099src" href="#xd26e3099" name=
"xd26e3099src">104</a> (from a flint), we used to broil and eat them.
The horses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3111" href="#xd26e3111"
name="xd26e3111">93</a>]</span>we let loose [to graze], and they
generally found sufficient to satisfy their hunger from the grass and
leaves.</p>
<p>One day we reached a large even plain, where there was no trace of
any habitation, and where no human face could be seen; even in this
[solitary and dreary scene], owing to the princess&rsquo;s company, the
day appeared festive and the nights joyful. Proceeding on our journey,
we came suddenly to a large river, the sight of which would appal the
firmest heart.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3115src" href="#xd26e3115"
name="xd26e3115src">105</a> As we stood on its banks, as far as the eye
could reach, nothing was to be seen but water; no means of crossing was
to be found. O God [cried I], how shall we pass this sea! we stood
reflecting on this sad obstacle for a few moments, when the thought
came into my mind to leave the princess there, and to go in search of a
boat; and that until I could find some means to pass over, the princess
would have time to rest. Having formed this plan, I said, &ldquo;O
princess, if you will allow me, I will go and look out for a ferry or
ford.&rdquo; She replied, &ldquo;I am greatly tired, and likewise
hungry and thirsty; I will rest here a little, whilst thou findest out
some means to pass over [the river].&rdquo;</p>
<p>On that spot was a large <i>p&#299;pal</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3122src" href="#xd26e3122" name="xd26e3122src">106</a> tree,
forming a canopy [of such extent], that if a thousand horsemen
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3137" href="#xd26e3137" name=
"xd26e3137">94</a>]</span>sheltered themselves under its wide-spread
branches, they would be protected from the sun and rain. Leaving there
the princess, I set out, and was looking all around to find somewhere
or other on the ground, or the river, some trace of a human being. I
searched much, but found the same nowhere. At last, I returned
hopeless, but did not find the princess under the tree; how can I
describe the state of my mind at that moment! my senses forsook me, and
I became quite distracted. Sometimes I mounted the tree, and looked for
her in every individual leaf and branch; sometimes, letting go my hold,
I fell on the ground, and went round the roots of the tree as one who
performs the <i>ta&#7779;addu&#7731;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3141src" href="#xd26e3141" name="xd26e3141src">107</a>. Sometimes
I wept and shrieked at my miserable condition; now I ran from west to
east, then from north to south. In short, I searched
everywhere,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3147src" href="#xd26e3147" name=
"xd26e3147src">108</a> but could not find any trace of the rare jewel
[I had lost]; when, at last, I found I could do nothing, then weeping
and throwing dust over my head, I looked for her everywhere.</p>
<p>This idea came into my mind, that perhaps some of the <i>jinns</i>
had carried her away, and had inflicted on me this wound; or else that
some one had followed her from her country, and finding her alone, had
persuaded her to return to Damascus. Distracted with these fancies, I
threw off and cast away my clothes, and becoming a naked
<i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i>, I wandered about in the kingdom of Syria from
morn until eve, and at night lay down to rest in any place [I could
find]. I wandered over the whole region, but could find no trace
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3158" href="#xd26e3158" name=
"xd26e3158">95</a>]</span>of my princess, nor hear any thing of her
from any one, nor could I ascertain the cause of her disappearance.
Then this idea came into my mind, that since I could find no trace of
that beloved one, even life itself was a weariness. I perceived a
mountain in some wilderness; I ascended it, and formed the design of
throwing myself headlong [from its summit], that I might end my
wretched existence in a moment, by dashing my head to pieces against
the stones, then would my soul be freed from a state of affliction.</p>
<p>Having formed this resolution within myself, I was on the point of
precipitating myself [from the mountain], and had even lifted up my
foot, when some one laid hold of my arm. In the meanwhile, I regained
my senses, and looking round, I saw a horseman clothed in green, with a
veil thrown over his face, who said to me, &ldquo;Why dost thou attempt
to destroy thy life; it is impious to despair of God&rsquo;s mercy;
whilst there is breath, so long there is hope. Three <i>Darweshes</i>
will meet thee a few days hence, in the empire of <i>R&#363;m</i>, who
are equally afflicted with thyself, entangled in the same difficulties,
and who have met with adventures similar to thine; the name of the king
of that country is <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>; he is also in
great trouble; when he meets you and the other three <i>Darweshes</i>,
then the wishes and desires of the heart of each of you will be
completely fulfilled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I instantly laid hold of the stirrup [of this guardian angel,] and
kissed it, and exclaimed, &ldquo;O messenger of God, the few words you
have pronounced have consoled my afflicted heart; but tell me, for
God&rsquo;s sake, who you are, and what is your name.&rdquo; He
replied, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3176" href="#xd26e3176"
name="xd26e3176">96</a>]</span>&ldquo;My name is <i>Murtaz&#803;&#257;
&rsquo;Al&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3181src" href=
"#xd26e3181" name="xd26e3181src">109</a> and my office is this, that to
whomsoever there occurs a danger or difficulty, I am at hand to afford
relief.&rdquo; Having said this much, he vanished from my sight. In
short, having set my heart at ease from the happy tidings I received
from my spiritual guide <i>[Murtaz&#803;&#257; <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3200" title="Source: &rsquo;Ali">&rsquo;Al&#299;</span></i>],
&ldquo;the remover of difficulties,&rdquo; I formed the design of
[proceeding to] Constantinople. On the road I suffered all those
misfortunes which were decreed me by fate; with the hopes of meeting
the princess. Through the assistance of God, I am come here, and by
good fortune I have become honoured by your presence. The promised
meeting has taken place between us, and we have enjoyed each
other&rsquo;s society and conversation; now it only remains for us to
be known to, and acquainted with, the king <i>&#256;z&#257;d
Bak&#863;ht</i>.</p>
<p>Assuredly after this, we five shall attain the desires of our
hearts. Do you also beseech the blessings of God, and say amen. O ye
holy guides! such have been the adventures which have befallen this
bewildered wanderer, which have been faithfully related in your
presence; now let us look forward [to the time] when my trouble and
sorrows will be changed into joy and gladness by the recovery of the
princess. <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>, concealed in silence in
his corner, having heard with attention the story of the first
<i>Darwesh</i>, was greatly pleased; then he betook himself to listen
to the adventures of the next <i>Darwesh</i>. <span class=

month of <i>Ramaz&#804;&#257;n</i> consisting of thirty days, is the

evening; more especially in high latitudes, should the

religions observance this same fast, enjoined by <i>Muh&#803;ammad</i>,
is the most absurd, the most demoralizing, and the most hurtful to
health that ever was invented by priestcraft. The people are forced to
starve themselves during the whole day, and consequently they overeat
themselves during the whole night, when they ought to be asleep in
their beds, as nature intended. Hence they fall by thousands an easy
prey to cholera, as happened in Turkey a few years ago. The fast of
Lent among tho followers of the Pope of Rome is, though in a less
degree, liable to the same censure. Why, instead of these unwholesome
observances, do not the priests, whether of Mecca or of Rome, preach
unto the people temperance and regularity of living? Ah, I forgot, the
priests both of Mecca and of Rome can always grant <i>dispensations</i>

&ldquo;petition.&rdquo; &ldquo;May I request some friend in India, for
auld lang syne, to ask any intelligent <i>munsh&#299;</i> the exact

occurs.&rdquo; To this request I received, a few months ago, a very
kind and satisfactory reply from Lieut. J.C. Bayley, 36th Regt.,
M.N.I., which I have the pleasure here to insert; and at the same time,
I beg to return my best thanks to that gentleman. &ldquo;The <i>five

<i>pesh-&#7731;abz&#803;</i> or dagger; 3rd, the <i>tabar</i> or
battle-axe; 4th, the <i>barchh&#299;</i> or lance; 5th, the <i>t&#299;r
o kam&#257;n</i> or the bow and arrows. The phrase,
<i>p&#257;ncho&#7749; hathiy&#257;r b&#257;ndhn&#257;</i> is very
nearly equivalent to our expression, &lsquo;to be armed cap &agrave;

in more recent times, the &ldquo;bow and arrows&rdquo; are very

"xd26e3287" href="#xd26e3287" name="xd26e3287">98</a>]</span>that
region is delightful, and the inhabitants are of enlightened minds, and
refined in their manners. My father (who was the king of that country),
in order to teach me the rules and lessons of government, made choice
of very wise tutors in every art and science, and placed them over me
for my instruction from my infancy. So, having received complete
instruction in every kind [of knowledge], I am now learned. With the
favour of God, in my fourteenth year I had learned every science,
polite conversation, and polished manners; and I had acquired all that
is fit and requisite for kings to know; moreover, my inclinations night
and day, led me to associate with the learned, and hear the histories
of every country, and of ambitious princes and men of renown.</p>
<p>One day, a learned companion, who was well versed in history, and
had seen [a great deal of] the world, said to me, &ldquo;That though
there is no reliance on the life of man, yet such excellent qualities
are often found in him, that owing to them, the name of some men will
be handed down with praise on people&rsquo;s tongues to the day of
judgment.&rdquo; I begged of him to relate circumstantially a few
instances on that score, that I might hear them, and endeavour to act
accordingly. Then that person began to relate as follows, some of the
adventures of <i>H&#803;&#257;tim T&#257;&rsquo;&#299;</i>. &ldquo;That
there lived in the time of <i>H&#257;tim</i>, a king of Arabia, named
<i>Naufal</i>, who bore great enmity towards <i>H&#257;tim</i>, on
account of his renown, and having assembled many troops, he went up to
give him battle. <i>H&#257;tim</i> was a God-fearing and good man; he
thus conceived, that, <span class="corr" id="xd26e3307" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span>If I likewise prepare for battle, then
the creatures of God will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3310"
href="#xd26e3310" name="xd26e3310">99</a>]</span>slaughtered, and there
will be much bloodshed; the punishment of heaven for which will be
recorded against my name.&rdquo; Reflecting on this, he quite alone,
taking merely his life with him, fled and hid himself in a cave in the
mountains. When the news of <i>H&#257;tim&rsquo;s</i> flight reached
<i>Naufal</i>, he confiscated all the property and dwellings of
<i>H&#257;tim</i>, and proclaimed publicly, that whoever would look out
for him and seize him, should receive from the king&rsquo;s treasury
five hundred pieces of gold. On hearing this [proclamation], all became
eager, and began to make diligent search for <i>H&#257;tim</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, an old man and his wife, taking two or three of
their young children with them, for the purpose of picking up wood,
strayed near the cave where <i>H&#257;tim</i> was concealed; and began
to gather fuel in that same forest. The old woman remarked, &lsquo;If
our days had been at all fortunate, we should have seen and found
<i>H&#257;tim</i> somewhere or other, and seizing him, we should have
carried him to <i>Naufal</i>; then he would give us five hundred pieces
of gold, and we should live comfortably, and be released from this toil
and care,&rsquo; The old woodman said, &lsquo;What art thou prating
about? it was decreed in our fate, that we should pick up wood every
day, place it on our heads, and sell it in the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i>,
and [with its produce] procure bread and salt; or one day the tiger of
the woods will carry us off: peace, mind thy work; why should
<i>H&#257;tim</i> fall into our hands, and the king give us so much
money?&rsquo; The old woman heaved a cold sigh, and remained
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>H&#257;tim</i> had heard the words of the two [old
people], and conceived it unmanly and ungenerous to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3346" href="#xd26e3346" name=
"xd26e3346">100</a>]</span>conceal himself to save his life, and not to
conduct those helpless ones to the object of their desire. True it is,
that a man without pity is not a human being, and he in whose heart
there is no feeling is a butcher.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Man was created to exercise compassion,</p>
<p class="line">Otherwise, angels were not wanting for
devotion.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In short, <i>H&#257;tim&rsquo;s</i> manly mind would
not allow him to remain concealed, after what he had with his own ears
heard [from the woodman]; he instantly came out, and said to the old
man, &lsquo;O friend, I myself am <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i>, lead me to
<i>Naufal</i>; on seeing me, he will give thee whatever amount of money
he has promised.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3364src" href=
"#xd26e3364" name="xd26e3364src">5</a> The old woodman replied,
&lsquo;It is true that my welfare and advantage certainly consist in
doing so, but who knows how he will treat thee; if he should put thee
to death, then what shall I do? This, on my part, can never be
done&mdash;that I should deliver over thee to thine enemy for the sake
of my own avarice. In a few days I shall spend the [promised] wealth,
and how long shall I live? I must die at last; then what answer shall I
give to God?&rsquo; <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> implored him greatly, and
said, &lsquo;Take me along with thee&mdash;I say so of my own pleasure;
I have ever desired that, should my wealth and life be of use to some
one or other [of my fellow creatures], then so much the
better.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3380" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> But the old man could not in any way be
persuaded to carry <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> along with him, and receive
the [proclaimed reward. At last, becoming hopeless,
<i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3389" href=
"#xd26e3389" name="xd26e3389">101</a>]</span>said, &lsquo;If you do not
carry me in the way I wish, then I will go of myself to the king, and
say, this old man concealed me in a cave in the mountains,&rsquo; The
old man smiled and said, &lsquo;If I am to receive evil for good, then
hard will be my fate.&rsquo; During this conversation, other men
arrived, and a crowd assembled [around them]; perceiving the person
they saw to be <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i>, they instantly seized him and
carried him along; the old man also, a little in the rear, followed
them in silent grief. When they brought <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> before
<i>Naufal</i>, he asked, &lsquo;Who has seized and brought him
here?&rsquo; A worthless, hard-hearted [boaster] answered, &lsquo;Who
could have performed such a deed except myself? This achievement
belongs to my name, and I have planted the standard [of glory] in the
sky.&rsquo; Another vaunting fellow clamoured, &lsquo;I searched for
him many days in the woods, and caught him at last, and have brought
him here; have some consideration for my labour, and give me what has
been promised.<span class="corr" id="xd26e3401" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> In this manner, from avidity for the
[promised] pieces of gold, every one said he had done the deed. The old
man, in silence, sat apart in a corner, and heard all their boastings,
and wept for <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i>. When each had recounted his act
of bravery and enterprise, then <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> said to the
king, &lsquo;If you ask for the truth, then it is this; that old man,
who stands aloof from all, has brought me here; if you can judge from
appearances, then ascertain the fact, and give him for my seizure what
you have promised; for in the whole body the tongue<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3410src" href="#xd26e3410" name="xd26e3410src">6</a> is a most
sacred [member]. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3459" href=
"#xd26e3459" name="xd26e3459">102</a>]</span>is incumbent upon a man to
perform what he has promised; for in other respects God has given
tongues to brutes likewise; then what would have been the difference
between a man and other animals?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Naufal</i> called the old wood-cutter near him, and said,
&lsquo;Tell the truth; what is the real state of the matter; who has
seized and brought <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> here?&rsquo; The honest
fellow related truly all that had occurred from beginning to end, and
added, &lsquo;<i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> is come here of his own accord
for my sake.&rsquo; <i>Naufal</i>, on hearing this manly act of
<i>H&#803;&#257;tim&rsquo;s</i>, was greatly astonished, and exclaimed,
&lsquo;How surprising is thy liberality! even thy life thou hast not
feared to risk [for the good of others]!&rsquo; With regard to all
those who laid false claims to having seized <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i>,
the king ordered them to have their hands tied behind their backs, and
instead of five hundred pieces of gold, to receive each five hundred
strokes of a slipper on their heads, so that their lives might perish
[under the punishment]. Instantly, the strokes of the slippers began to
be laid on in such a style, that in a short <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3482" href="#xd26e3482" name=
"xd26e3482">103</a>]</span>time their heads became quite bald. True it
is, that to tell an untruth is such a guilt, that no other guilt equals
it; may God keep every one free from this calamity, and not give him a
propensity for telling lies; many people persevere in uttering
falsehoods, but at the moment of detection they meet with their
dessert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, <i>Naufal</i> having rewarded all of them according
to their desserts, thought it contrary to gentlemanly conduct and
manliness of character to harbour enmity and strife towards a man like
<i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i>, from whom multitudes received happiness, and
who, for the sake of the necessitous, did not even spare his own life,
and was entirely devoted to the ways of God. He instantly seized
<i>H&#803;&#257;tim&rsquo;s</i> hand with great cordiality and
friendship, and said to him, &lsquo;Why should it not be the
case?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3501src" href="#xd26e3501" name=
"xd26e3501src">7</a> such a man as you are can perform such an
action.&rsquo; Then the king, with great respect and attention, made
<i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> sit down near him, and he instantly restored to
him the lands and property, and the wealth and moveables, he had
confiscated; and bestowed on him anew the chieftainship of the tribe of
<i>T&#804;&#257;,&#299;</i>, and ordered the five hundred pieces of
gold to be given to the old man from the treasury, who, blessing [the
king], went away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had heard the whole of this adventure of
<i>H&#257;tim&rsquo;s</i>, a spirit of rivalry came into my mind; and
this idea occurred to me, viz., &ldquo;<i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> was the
only chief of his own tribe [of Arabs]. He, by one act of liberality
has gained such renown, that to this day it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3526" href="#xd26e3526" name=
"xd26e3526">104</a>]</span>is celebrated; whilst I am, by the decree of
God, the king of all <i>&#298;r&#257;n</i>; and it would be a pity if I
were to remain excluded from this good fortune. It is certain that in
this world no quality is greater than generosity and liberality; for
whatever a man bestows in this world, he receives its return in the
next. If any one sows a single seed, then how much does he reap from
its produce! With these ideas impressed upon my mind, I called for the
lord of the buildings, and ordered him to erect, as speedily as
possible, a grand palace without the city, with forty high and wide
gates.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3531src" href="#xd26e3531" name=
"xd26e3531src">8</a> In a short time, even such a grand palace as my
heart wished for, was built and got ready, and in that place every day
at all times, from morning till night, I used to bestow pieces of
silver and gold on the poor and helpless; whoever asked for anything in
charity, I granted it to the utmost of his desire.</p>
<p>In short, the necessitous entered [daily] through the forty gates,
and received whatever they wanted. It happened one day that a
<i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i> came in from the front gate and begged some
alms. I gave him a gold piece; then the same person entered through the
next gate, and asked two pieces of gold; though I recollected
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3558" href="#xd26e3558" name=
"xd26e3558">105</a>]</span>him [to be the same <i><span class="corr"
id="xd26e3561" title=
"Source: fa&#7731;ir">fa&#7731;&#299;r</span></i>], I passed over [the
circumstance] and gave them. In this manner he came in through each
gate, and increased a piece of gold in his demand each time; and I
knowingly appeared ignorant [of the circumstance], and continued
supplying him according to his demand. At last he entered by the
fortieth gate, and asked forty pieces of gold&mdash;this sum I likewise
ordered to be given him. After receiving so much, the
<i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i> re-entered from the first gate and again begged
alms: his conduct appeared to me highly impudent, and I said, hear, O
avaricious man, what kind of a <i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i> art thou, that
dost not even know the meaning of the three letters which compose the
word <span class="Arabic" lang="ar">&#1601;&#1602;&#1585;&lrm;</span>
<i>fa&#7731;r</i> (poverty); a <i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i> ought to act up
to them. He replied, &ldquo;Well, generous soul, explain them
yourself.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;<span class="Arabic" lang=
"ar">&#1601;&lrm;</span> <i>fe</i> means <i>f&#257;&#7731;a</i>
(fasting); <span class="Arabic" lang="ar">&#1602;&lrm;</span>

has not these three qualities, is not a <i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i>. All
this which you have received, eat and drink with it, and when it is

is bestowed on thee to relieve immediate wants and not for the purpose

from one piece of gold up to forty; add up the amount, and see by the

much money? A [real] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3618" href=

day the great Provider [of necessaries] will afford thee a new
pittance. Now evince some shame and modesty; have patience, and be
content; what sort of mendicity is this that thy spiritual guide hath
taught thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these reproaches of mine, he became displeased and angry,
and threw down on the ground all [the money] he had received from me,
and said, &ldquo;Enough, sir, do not be so warm; take back your gifts
and keep them, and do not again pronounce the word generosity. It is
very difficult to be generous; you are not able to support the weight
of generosity, when will you attain to that station?<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3624src" href="#xd26e3624" name="xd26e3624src">10</a> you are
as yet very far from it. The word <span class="Arabic" lang=
"ar">&#1587;&#1582;&#1610;&lrm;</span> <i>Sak&#863;h&#299;</i>
(generous), is also composed of three letters; first act up to the
meaning of those three letters, then you will be called
generous.&rdquo; On hearing this I became uneasy, and said to the
<i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i>, well, holy pilgrim, explain to me the meaning
of those three letters. He replied, &ldquo;from <span class="Arabic"
lang="ar">&#1587;&lrm;</span> <i>s&#299;n</i> is derived
<i>sam&#257;,&#299;</i> (endurance); from <span class="Arabic" lang=
"ar">&#1582;&lrm;</span> <i>k&#863;he</i> comes <i>k&#863;haufi
Il&#257;h&#299;</i> (fear of God); and from <span class="Arabic" lang=
"ar">&#1610;&lrm;</span> <i>ye</i> proceeds <i>y&#257;d</i>
(remembrance of one&rsquo;s birth and death). Until one is possessed of
these three qualities, he should not mention the name of generosity;
and the generous man has also this happiness, that although he acts
amiss [in other points], yet he is dear to his Maker [on account of his
generosity]. I have travelled through many countries, but except the
princess of <i>Ba&#7779;ra</i>, I have not seen a [person really]
generous. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3671" href="#xd26e3671"
name="xd26e3671">107</a>]</span>The robe of generosity God hath shaped
out on [the person] of that woman; all others desire the name, but do
not act up to it.&rdquo; On hearing this, I made much entreaty, and
conjured him [by all that was sacred] to forgive my rebuke, and take
whatever he required. He would not, on any account, accept my proffered
gifts, but went away repeating these words, &ldquo;Now if thou wert to
give all thy kingdom, I would not spit upon it, nor would I even
**.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3676src" href="#xd26e3676" name=
"xd26e3676src">11</a> The pilgrim went away, but having heard such
praises of the princess of <i>Ba&#7779;ra</i>, my heart became quite
restless, and no way could I be easy. Now this desire arose within me,
that by some means or other I must go to <i>Ba&#7779;ra</i> and take a
look at her.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the king, my father, died, and I ascended the
throne. I got the empire, but the idea [I had formed of going to
<i>Ba&#7779;ra</i>] did not leave me. I held a consultation with the
<i>waz&#299;r</i> and nobles, who were the support of the throne, and
the pillars of the empire, saying, I wish to make a journey to
<i>B&#257;&#7779;ra</i>. Do ye remain steady in your respective
stations; if I live, then the duration of the journey will be short; I
will soon be back. No one seemed pleased at the idea of my going; in my
helplessness, my heart continued to become more and more sorrowful. One
day, without consulting any one, I privately sent for the resourceful
<i>waz&#299;r</i>, and made him regent and plenipotentiary [during my
absence], and placed him at the head of the affairs of the empire. I
then put on the ochre-coloured habit [of a pilgrim], and, assuming
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3703" href="#xd26e3703" name=
"xd26e3703">108</a>]</span>the appearance of a <i>fa&#7731;&#299;r</i>,
I took the road to <i>Ba&#7779;ra</i> alone. In a few days, I reached
its boundaries, and [constantly] began to witness this scene; wherever
I halted for the night, the servants of the princess advanced to
receive me, and made me halt at some elegant house, and they used to
provide me in perfection with all the requisites of a banquet, and to
remain in attendance on me all night with the utmost respect. The
following day, at the next stage, I experienced the same reception. In
this comfort I journeyed onwards for months; at last I entered [the
city of] <i>Ba&#7779;ra</i>. I had no sooner entered it, than a
good-looking young man, well dressed, and well-behaved, who carried
wisdom in his looks, came up to me, and said with extreme sweetness of
address, &ldquo;I am the servant of pilgrims; I am always on the look
out to conduct to my house all travellers, whether pilgrims or men of
the world, who come to this city; except my house alone, there is no
other place here for a stranger to put up at; pray, holy sir, come with
me, bestow honour on my abode, and render me exalted.</p>
<p>I asked him, &ldquo;what is the noble name of your honour?&rdquo; He
replied, &ldquo;they call the name of this nameless one <i>Bed&#257;r
Bak&#863;ht</i>.&rdquo; Seeing his good qualities and affable manners,
I went along with him and came to his house. I saw a grand mansion
fitted up in a princely style&mdash;he led me to a grand apartment, and
made me sit down; and sending for warm water, he caused [the
attendants] to wash my hands and feet; and having caused the
<i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;an</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e3722src"
href="#xd26e3722" name="xd26e3722src">12</a> to be spread, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3748" href="#xd26e3748" name=
"xd26e3748">109</a>]</span>steward placed before me alone a great
variety of trays and dishes, and large quantities of fruit and
confectionery.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3750src" href="#xd26e3750"
name="xd26e3750src">13</a> On seeing such a grand treat, my very soul
was satiated, and taking a mouthful from each dish, my stomach was
filled; I then drew back my hand from eating.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3756src" href="#xd26e3756" name="xd26e3756src">14</a></p>
<p>The young man became very pressing, and said, &ldquo;Sir, what have
you eaten? all the dinner remains as it were for a deposit;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3761src" href="#xd26e3761" name=
"xd26e3761src">15</a> eat some more without ceremony.&rdquo; I replied,
there is no shame in eating; God prosper your house, I have eaten as
much as my stomach can contain, and I cannot sufficiently praise the
relish of your feast, and even now my tongue <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3764" href="#xd26e3764" name=
"xd26e3764">110</a>]</span>smacks with their flavour, and every
belch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3766src" href="#xd26e3766" name=
"xd26e3766src">16</a> I make is absolutely perfumed, now pray take them
away. &ldquo;When the <i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;n</i> was removed,
they spread a carpet of <i>k&#257;sh&#257;n&#299;</i> velvet, and
brought to me ewers and basins of gold, with scented soap and warm
water, wherewithal I might wash my hands; then <i>betel</i> was
introduced, in a box set with precious stones, and spices of various
kinds; whenever I called for water to drink, the servants brought it
cooled in ice. When the evening came, camphorated candles were lighted
up in the glass shades; and that friendly young man sat down near me
and entertained me with his conversation. When one watch of the night
had elapsed, he said to me, &ldquo;be pleased to sleep in this bed, in
front of which are curtains and screens.&rdquo; I said, O, Sir, for us
pilgrims a mat or a deer-skin is sufficient; this [luxury] God has
ordained for you men of the world.</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;All these things are for pilgrims; they do not in
the least belong to me.&rdquo; On his pressing me so urgently, I went
and lay down on the bed which was softer than even a bed of flowers.
Pots of roses and baskets of flowers were placed on both sides of the
bedstead, and aloes and other perfumes were burning; to whichever side
I turned, my senses were intoxicated with fragrance; in this state I
slept. When the morning came, [the attendants] placed before me for
breakfast, almonds, pistachio nuts, grapes, figs, pears, pomegranates,
currants, dates, and <i>sharbat</i> made of fruit. In this festive
manner I passed three days and nights. On the fourth day I requested
leave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3784" href="#xd26e3784" name=
"xd26e3784">111</a>]</span>to depart. The young man said, with joined
hands, &ldquo;Perhaps I have been deficient in my attentions to you,
for which reason you are displeased.&rdquo; I replied with
astonishment, for God&rsquo;s sake, what a speech is this? the rules of
hospitality [require one to stay] three days&mdash;these have I
fulfilled; to remain longer would be improper; and besides this, I have
set out to travel, and if I remain merely at one place, then it will
not suit; for which reason I beg leave to depart; in other respects,
your kindness is such that my heart does not wish to be separated from
you.</p>
<p>He then said, &ldquo;Do as you please; but wait a moment, that I may
go to the princess and in her presence mention [the circumstance]; and
as you wish to depart [be it known to you], that all the wearing
apparel and bedding, also the vessels of silver and gold, and the
jewelled vessels in this guest&rsquo;s apartment, are your property;
whatever directions you may give for the purpose of taking them away,
an arrangement [to that effect] shall be made.&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;cease<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3788src" href="#xd26e3788"
name="xd26e3788src">17</a> to talk in this manner; I am a pilgrim, and
not a strolling bard; if such avarice had a place in my heart, then why
should I have turned pilgrim; and where would be the evil of [my
leading] a worldly life?&rdquo; That kind young man replied, &ldquo;If
the princess should hear of this circumstance [of your refusal], she
will discharge me from my employment, and God knows what other
punishment I shall receive; if you are so indifferent [to possess
them], then lock up all these articles in a room, and put your seal on
the door, and you may hereafter dispose of them as you please.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3794" href="#xd26e3794" name=
"xd26e3794">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>I would not accept [his offer], and he would not submit [to me]. At
last, this plan was adopted, I locked them all up in a room, and put my
seal on the door, and waited [with impatience] for leave of departing.
In the meantime a confidential eunuch, having on his head an aigrette,
and a short robe round his loins, and a golden mace studded with gems
in his hand, accompanied by several other respectable attendants,
filling [various] offices, came near me with this splendour and pomp.
He addressed me with such kindness and complaisance that I cannot
express it, and added, &ldquo;O, sir, if shewing kindness and
benevolence, you do me the favour to dignify my humble dwelling with
your presence, then it will not be far from courtesy and
condescension.</p>
<p>Perhaps the princess will hear that a traveller had been here, and
no one had received him with courtesy and politeness; and that he had
gone away as he came; for this reason God knows what punishment she
will inflict on me, or how far her displeasure will be raised; yea
more, it is a matter affecting my life,&rdquo; I refused to listen to
his request, but through dint of solicitations he overcame my
resistance, and conducted me to another house, which was better than
the first Like the former host, he entertained me twice a day for three
days and nights, with the same kind of meals, and in the morning and
afternoon sherbet, and fruits for passing away the time, and he told me
that I was the master of all the rich gold and silver dishes, carpets,
&amp;c, and that I might do with them whatever I pleased.</p>
<p>On hearing these strange proposals, I was quite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3801" href="#xd26e3801" name=
"xd26e3801">113</a>]</span>confounded, and wished that I might by some
means take my leave and escape from this place. On perceiving my
[embarassed] countenance, the eunuch said, &ldquo;O creature of God,
whatever your wants or wishes may be, impart them to me, that I may lay
them before the princess.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;in the garb of a
pilgrim, how can I desire the riches of this world, which you offer me
unasked, and which I refuse?&rdquo; He then said, &ldquo;The desire of
worldly goods forsakes the heart of no one, for which reason some poet
has composed these verses:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<p class="first">On hearing these [lines], I replied, what you say is
true, but I want nothing; if you will permit, I will write out a note
and send it which will express my wish, and which you will convey to
the presence of the princess, it will be [doing me] a great favour, as
if I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3875" href="#xd26e3875" name=
"xd26e3875">114</a>]</span>had received all the riches in the world.
The eunuch said, &ldquo;I will do it with pleasure, there is no
difficulty in it.&rdquo; I immediately wrote a note to the following
purport:&mdash;first, I began with the praise of God; I then related my
circumstances and situation, saying, &ldquo;that this creature of God
had, some days since, arrived in the city, and from the munificence of
her government, had been taken care of in every way; that I had heard
such accounts of her highness&rsquo;s generosity and munificence, as
had raised in me an ardent desire to see her, and that I had found
those qualities four-fold greater than they had been represented. Your
nobles now tell me to set forth before you whatever wants or wishes I
may have; for this reason I beg to represent to you without ceremony
the wishes of my heart. I am not in want of the riches of this world. I
am also the king of my own country; my sole reason for coming so far
and undergoing such fatigues, was the ardent desire I had to see you,
which motive only has conducted me here in this manner quite alone. I
now hope through your benevolence to attain the wishes of my heart; I
shall then be satisfied. Any further favours will rest with your
pleasure; but if the request of this wretch is not granted, then he
will wander about in this same manner, encountering hardships, and
sacrifice his restless life to the passion he feels for you. Like
<i>Majn&#363;n</i> and <i>Farh&#257;d</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3883src" href="#xd26e3883" name="xd26e3883src">21</a> he will end
his life in some forest or mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having written my wishes, I gave the note to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3902" href="#xd26e3902" name=
"xd26e3902">115</a>]</span>eunuch; he carried it to the princess. After
a short while, he returned and called me, and conducted me to the door
of the seraglio. On arriving there, I saw an elderly and respectable
woman dressed in jewels, sitting on a golden stool, and many eunuchs
and other servants richly clothed, were standing before her with arms
across. I imagining her to be the superintendent of affairs, and
regarding her as a venerable [person], made her my obeisance; the old
lady returned my salute with much civility, and said, &ldquo;Come and
sit down, you are welcome; it is you who wrote an affectionate note to
the princess.&rdquo; I feeling ashamed, hung down my head and remained
sitting silent.</p>
<p>After a short pause, she said, &ldquo;O, young man, the princess has
sent you her <i>sal&#257;m</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3909src"
href="#xd26e3909" name="xd26e3909src">22</a> and said thus,
&lsquo;There is nothing wrong in my taking a husband; you have
solicited me [in marriage]; but to speak of your kingdom, and to
conceive yourself a king in this mendicant state, and to be proud of
it, is quite out of place; for this reason, that all men among each
other are certainly equal; although superior consideration ought to be
due to those who are of the religion of <i>Muhammad</i>. I also have
wished for a long while to marry, and as you are indifferent to worldly
riches, to me likewise God has given such wealth as cannot be counted.
But there is one condition, that first of all you procure my marriage
portion.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3918src" href="#xd26e3918"
name="xd26e3918src">23</a> The marriage-gift of the princess,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3924" href="#xd26e3924" name=
"xd26e3924">116</a>]</span>added the old lady, &ldquo;is a certain task
to perform, if yon can fulfil it.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am ready
in every way, and I shall not be sparing of my wealth or life; tell me
what the task is, that I may hear it. The old woman then said,
&ldquo;Remain here to-day, and tomorrow I will tell it to you.&rdquo; I
accepted [her proposal] with pleasure, and taking my leave, I came
out.</p>
<p>The day had in the meantime passed away, and when the evening came,
a eunuch called upon me, and conducted me to the seraglio. On entering,
I saw that the nobles, the learned, the virtuous, and the sages of the
divine law were present. I likewise joined the assembly and sat down.
In the meantime the cloth for the repast was spread, and eatables of
every variety, both sweet and salt, were laid out. They all began to
eat, and with courtesy solicited me to join them. When dinner was over,
a female servant came out from the interior [of the seraglio] and
asked, &ldquo;Where is <i>Bahrawar</i>? call him.&rdquo; The servants
in waiting brought him immediately; his appearance was very
respectable, and many keys of silver and gold were suspended from his
waist. After saluting me, he sat down by me. The same female servant
said, &ldquo;O, <i>Bahrawar</i>, whatever thou hast seen, relate it
fully [to this stranger].&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Bahrawar</i>, addressing himself to me, began the following
narration:&mdash;&ldquo;O, friend! our princess possesses thousands of
slaves, who are established in trade; among them I am one of the
humblest of her hereditary servants. She sends them to different
countries with goods and merchandise, worth <i>l&#257;k&#863;hs</i> of
rupees, of which they have the charge; when these return [from the
respective countries to which they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e3941" href="#xd26e3941" name="xd26e3941">117</a>]</span>were sent
to trade], then the princess, in her own presence, inquires of them the
state and manners of such country, and hears [their different
accounts]. Once it so happened that this meanest [of her slaves] went
to the country and city of <i>N&#299;mroz</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3945src" href="#xd26e3945" name="xd26e3945src">24</a> to trade,
and perceiving that all the inhabitants were dressed in black, and that
they sighed and wept every moment, and it appeared to me that some sad
calamity had befallen them. From whomsoever I asked the reason [of
these strange circumstances], no one would answer my inquiry. One day,
the moment the morning appeared, all the inhabitants of the city,
little and great, young and old, poor and rich, issued forth. They went
out and assembled on a plain; the king of the country went there also
mounted on horseback, and surrounded by his nobles; then they all
formed a regular line, and stood still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also stood among them to see the strange sight, for it
clearly appeared that they were waiting for [the arrival of] some one.
In an hour&rsquo;s time a beautiful young man, of an angelic form,
about fifteen or sixteen years of age, uttering a loud noise, and
foaming at the mouth, and mounted on a dun bull, holding something in
one hand, approached from a distance, and came up in front of the
people; he descended from the bull, and sat down [oriental fashion] on
the ground, holding the halter of the animal in one hand, and a naked
sword in the other; a rosy-coloured, beautiful [attendant] was with
him; the young man gave him that which he held in his hand; the slave
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3958" href="#xd26e3958" name=
"xd26e3958">118</a>]</span>took it, and went along showing it to all of
them from one end of the line to the other; but such was the nature [of
the object], that whoever saw it, the same involuntarily wept aloud and
bitterly [at the strange sight]. In this way he continued to show it to
every one, and made every one weep; then passing along the front of the
line, he returned to his master again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment he came near him, the young man rose up, and with
the sword severed the attendant&rsquo;s head [from his body], and
having again mounted his bull, galloped off towards the quarter from
whence he had come. All [present] stood looking on. When he disappeared
from their sight, the inhabitants returned to the city. I was anxiously
asking every one I met the real meaning of this strange occurrence;
yea, I even held out the inducement of money and beseeched and
flattered them to get an explanation, who the young man was, and why he
committed the deed [I had seen], and from whence he came, and where he
went, but no one would give me the slightest information on the
subject, nor could I comprehend it. When I returned here, I related to
the princess the astonishing circumstance I had seen. Since then, the
princess herself has been amazed [at the strange event], and anxious to
ascertain its real cause. For which reason she has been fixed on this
very point as her marriage portion, that whatever man will bring her a
true and particular account of that strange circumstance, she will
accept him [in marriage]; and he shall be the master of all her wealth,
her country, and herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[<i>Bahrawar</i> concluded by saying], &ldquo;You have now
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3967" href="#xd26e3967" name=
"xd26e3967">119</a>]</span>heard every circumstance; reflect within
yourself if you can bring the intelligence [which is required]
respecting the young man, then undertake the journey towards the
country of <i>N&#299;mroz</i>, and depart soon, or else refuse [the
conditions and the attempt], and return to your home.&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;If God please, I will soon ascertain all the
circumstances [relating to the strange event], and return to the
princess with success; or if my fate be unlucky, then there is no
remedy; but the princess must give me her solemn promise she will not
swerve from what she engages [to perform]. And now an uneasy
apprehension arises in my heart; if the princess will have the
benevolence to call me before her, and allow me to sit down outside the
<i>parda</i>, and hear with her own ears the request I have made, and
favour me with an answer from her own lips; then my heart will be at
ease, and every thing will be possible for me.&rdquo; These my requests
the female servant related to the fairy-formed princess. At last, by
way of condescension, she ordered me to be called before her.</p>
<p>The same female returned, and conducted me to the apartment where
the princess was; what [a display of beauty] I saw! Handsome female
slaves and servants, and armed damsels, from <i>Kilm&#257;k,
Turkist&#257;n, Abyssinia, Uzbak Tartary and K&#257;shm&#299;r</i>,
were drawn up in two lines, dressed in rich jewels, with their arms
folded across, and each standing in her appropriate station. Shall I
call this the court of Indra? or is it a descent on the part of the
fairies? an involuntary sigh of rapture escaped [from my breast], and
my heart began to palpitate; but I forcibly restrained <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3980" href="#xd26e3980" name=
"xd26e3980">120</a>]</span>myself. Regarding them all around, I
advanced on; but my feet became each as heavy as a hundred
<i>mans</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3985src" href="#xd26e3985"
name="xd26e3985src">25</a> Whenever I gazed on one of those lovely
women, my heart was unwilling to proceed farther. On one side [of the
saloon] a screen was suspended, and a stool set with precious stones
was placed near it, as well as a chair of sandal-wood; the female
servant made me a sign to sit down on the [jewelled] stool; I sat down
upon it, and she seated herself on the [sandal-wood chair]; she said,
&ldquo;Now, whatever you have to say, speak it fully and from the
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I first extolled the princess&rsquo;s excellent qualities, also her
justice and liberality; I then added, that &ldquo;ever since I have
entered the limits of this country, I saw at every stage accommodations
for travellers and lofty buildings; and found everywhere servants of
all grades appointed to attend upon travellers and necessitous persons.
I have likewise spent three days at every halting place, and the fourth
day, when I wished to take my leave, no one said with good will,
&ldquo;You may depart;&rdquo; and whatever articles and furniture had
been [applied to my use] at those places, such as chequered
carpets,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3993src" href="#xd26e3993" name=
"xd26e3993src">26</a> &amp;c., &amp;c., I was told that they were all
mine, and that I might either take them away or lock them up in a room,
and put my seal on it; that, should it be my pleasure, whenever I came
back I might take them away. I have done so; but the wonder is, that if
a lonely pilgrim like me has met with such a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3996" href="#xd26e3996" name=
"xd26e3996">121</a>]</span>[princely] reception, then there must be
thousands of such pilgrims who will resort to your dominions; and if
every one is hospitably received in the same manner [as myself], sums
incalculable must be spent. Now, whence comes the great wealth of which
there is such an expenditure, and of what nature is it? The treasures
of <i>K&#257;r&#363;n</i> would not be equal to it; and if we look at
the princess&rsquo;s territories, it would appear that their revenues
would hardly suffice to defray the kitchen charges, setting the other
expenses aside. If the princess would condescend to explain this
[seeming wonder] with her own lips, then, my mind being set at ease, I
shall set out for the country of <i>N&#299;mroz</i>; and reaching it by
some means or other, after having learned all the particulars [of the
strange circumstance], I will return, if God should spare my life, to
the presence of the princess, and attain the desires of my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, the princess herself said, &ldquo;O youth,
if you have a strong desire to know the exact nature of these
circumstances, then stay here to-day also. I will send for you in the
evening, and the account of my vast riches shall be unfolded to you
without any reservation.&rdquo; After this assurance, I retired to my
place of residence, and waited anxiously, (saying,) &ldquo;when will
the evening arrive, that my curiosity may be gratified?&rdquo; In the
meantime a eunuch brought some covered trays on the heads of porters,
and laid them before me, and said, &ldquo;The princess has sent you a
dinner<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4007src" href="#xd26e4007" name=
"xd26e4007src">27</a> from her own table; partake of it.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4010" href="#xd26e4010" name=
"xd26e4010">122</a>]</span>When he uncovered the trays before me, the
rich fragrance [of the meats] intoxicated my brains, and my soul became
satiated. I ate as much as I could, and sent away the rest, and
returned my grateful thanks [to the princess.] At last, when the sun,
the traveller of the whole day, wearied and fatigued, reached his home,
and the moon advanced from her palace, attended by her companions, then
the female servant came to me and said, &ldquo;Come, the princess has
sent for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went along with her; she led me to the private apartment; the
effect of the lights was such that the <i>shabi &#7731;adr</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4016src" href="#xd26e4016" name=
"xd26e4016src">28</a> was nothing to it. A <i>masnad</i>, covered with
gold, was placed on rich carpets, with a pillow studded with jewels;
over it an awning of brocade was stretched, with a fringe of pearls on
[silver] poles studded with precious stones; and in front of the
<i>masnad</i> artificial trees formed of various jewels, with flowers
and leaves attached, (one would say they were nature&rsquo;s own
production,) were erected in beds of gold; and on the right and left,
beautiful slaves and servants were in waiting with folded arms and
down-cast eyes, in respectful attitude. Dancing women and female
singers, with ready-tuned instruments, attended to begin their
performances. On seeing such a scene and such splendid preparations, my
senses were bewildered. I asked the female servant [who came with me]
&ldquo;there is here such gay splendour in the scene of the day, and
such magnificence in that of the night, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4040" href="#xd26e4040" name="xd26e4040">123</a>]</span>that the
day may very justly be called <i>&rsquo;&#298;d</i>, and the night
<i>shabi bar&#257;t</i>; moreover, a king who possessed the whole world
could not exhibit greater splendour and magnificence. Is it always so
at the princess&rsquo;s court? The servant replied, &ldquo;The
princess&rsquo;s court ever displays the same magnificence you see now;
there is no abatement [or difference], except that it is sometimes
greater: sit you here; the princess is in another apartment,&mdash;I
will go and inform her of your arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, the nurse went away and quickly returned; he desired me
to come to the princess. The moment I entered her apartment I was
struck with amazement. I could not tell where the door was, or where
the walls, for they were covered with Aleppo mirrors, of the height of
a man, all around, the frames of which were studded with diamonds and
pearls. The reflection of one fell on the other, and it appeared as if
the whole room was inlaid with jewels. At one end a <i>parda</i> was
hung, behind which the princess sat. The female servant seated herself
close to the <i>parda</i>, and desired me to sit down also; then she
began the following narrative, according to the princess&rsquo;s
commands&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, O intelligent youth! The sultan of this
country was a potent king; he had seven daughters born in his house.
One day, the king held a festival, and these seven daughters were
standing before him [superbly dressed], with each sixteen jewels,
twelve ornaments, and in every hair an elephant pearl. Something came
into the king&rsquo;s mind, and he looked towards his daughters and
said, &lsquo;If your father had not been a king, and you had been born
in the house <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4057" href="#xd26e4057"
name="xd26e4057">124</a>]</span>of some poor man, then who would have
called you princesses? Praise God that you are called princesses; all
your good fortune depends on my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six of his daughters being of one mind, replied,
&lsquo;Whatever your majesty says, is true, and our happiness depends
on your welfare alone.&rsquo; But the princess now present, though she
was younger [than all her sisters], yet even in sense and judgment,
even at that age, she was superior to them, all. She stood silent, and
did not join her sisters in the reply they made; for this reason, that
to say so was impious. The king looked towards her with anger, and
said, &lsquo;Well, my lady, you say nothing; what is the cause of
this?&rsquo; Then the princess, tying both her hands with a
handkerchief, humbly replied, &lsquo;If your majesty will grant me
safety [of my life], and pardon my presumption, then this humble slave
will unfold the dictates of her heart.&rsquo; The king said,
&lsquo;Speak what thou hast to say.&rsquo; Then the princess said,
&lsquo;Mighty king, you must have heard, that the voice of truth is
bitter; for which reason, disregarding life at this moment, I presume
to address your majesty; whatever the great Writer has written in [the
book of] my destiny, no one can efface, and in no way can it be evaded.
&ldquo;Whether you bruise your feet [by depending on your own
exertions], or lay your head on the carpet [in prayer], your fate
[written] on the forehead, whatever it be, shall come to
pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;That Almighty Ruler, who has made you a king,
He indeed also has made me a princess. In the arsenal of his
omnipotence, no one has power. You are my sovereign and benefactor, and
if I should apply the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4063" href=
"#xd26e4063" name="xd26e4063">125</a>]</span>dust which lies under your
auspicious feet, as a colyrium [for my eyes], then it would become me;
but the destinies of every one are with every one.&rsquo; The king, on
hearing this [speech], became angry; the reply displeased him highly,
and he said with wrath, &lsquo;What great words issue from a little
mouth! Now let this be her punishment, that you strip off whatever
jewels she has on her hands and feet, and let her be placed in a
sedan-chair, and set down in such a wilderness, where no human traces
can be found; then we shall see what is written in her
destinies.<span class="corr" id="xd26e4065" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the king&rsquo;s commands, at that midnight
hour, when it was the very essence of darkness, the princess (who had
been reared with such delicacy and tenderness), and had seen no other
place except her own apartments, was carried by the porters in a
litter, and set down in a place where not even a bird ever flapped its
wing, much less did human creatures there exist; they left her there
and returned. The princess&rsquo;s heart was all at once in such a
state [as cannot be conceived]; reduced to what she was, from what she
had been! Then in the threshold of God, she offered up her prayers, and
said, &ldquo;Thou art so mighty [O Lord], that what thou hast wished,
Thou hast done; and whatever Thou willest, Thou dost; and whatever Thou
mayest wish, that Thou wilt do: whilst life remains in my nostrils, I
shall not be hopeless of [thy protection&rsquo;]. Impressed with these
thoughts, she fell asleep. When the morn appeared, the eyes of the
princess opened; she called for water to perform her ablutions. Then,
all at once, the occurrences of last night came to her recollection;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4070" href="#xd26e4070" name=
"xd26e4070">126</a>]</span>she said to herself, &lsquo;Where art thou,
and where this speech?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4072src" href=
"#xd26e4072" name="xd26e4072src">29</a> Saying this to herself, she got
up, and performed the <i>tayammum</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4078src" href="#xd26e4078" name="xd26e4078src">30</a> said her
prayers, and poured forth the praises of her Maker! O youth, the heart
is torn with anguish to reflect on the princess&rsquo;s sad condition
at that time. Ask that innocent and inexperienced heart what it
felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, she sat in the litter, and putting her trust in
God, she repeated to herself at that moment these verses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;When I had no teeth, then thou gavest milk;</p>
<p class="line">When thou hast given teeth, wilt thou not grant
food!</p>
<p class="line">He who takes care of the fowls of the air,</p>
<p class="line">And of all the animals of the earth,</p>
<p class="line">He will also take care of thee.</p>
<p class="line">Why art thou sad, simple-minded one!</p>
<p class="line">By being sorrowful thou&rsquo;lt get nothing;</p>
<p class="line">He who provides for the fool, for the wise, and for the
whole world,</p>
<p class="line">Will likewise provide for thee.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It is true, that when no resource remains, then
God is remembered, or else every one in his own plans, thinks himself a
<i>Lu&#7731;m&#257;n</i>, and a <i>B&#363;&rsquo; Al&#299;
S&#299;n&#257;</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4113src" href=
"#xd26e4113" name="xd26e4113src">31</a> Now listen to the surprising
ways of God. In this manner three days clear passed away, during which
a grain of food did not enter the princess&rsquo;s mouth; her
flower-like frame became quite withered as a [dry] thorn; and her
colour, which hitherto shone like gold, became yellow as turmeric; her
mouth became rigid, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4121" href=
"#xd26e4121" name="xd26e4121">127</a>]</span>and her eyes were
petrified, but still a faint respiration remained passing and
re-passing. Whilst there is life, there is hope. In the morning of the
fourth day, a hermit appeared of bright countenance, in appearance like
<i>K&#863;hiz&#803;r</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4127src" href=
"#xd26e4127" name="xd26e4127src">32</a> and of an enlightened heart.
Seeing the princess in that state, he said, &lsquo;O daughter, though
your father is a king, yet these [sorrows] were decreed in thy destiny.
Now, conceive this old hermit your servant, and think day and night of
your Maker. God will do what is right.&rsquo; And whatever morsels the
hermit had in his wallet, he laid them before the princess; then he
went in search of water; he saw a well, but where were the wheel and
bucket by means of which he might draw the water? He pulled off some
leaves from a tree, and made a cup, and taking off his sash, he
fastened the cup to it, and drew up some water, and gave it to the
princess. At last she regained her senses. The holy man, seeing her
helpless and solitary state, gave her every consolation, and cheered
her heart; and he himself began to weep. When the princess saw his
sympathetic grief, and [heard] his kind assurances, she became easy in
her mind. From that day, the old man made this an established rule,
that in the morning he went to the city to beg, and brought to the
princess whatever scraps or morsels he received. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4141" href="#xd26e4141" name=
"xd26e4141">128</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way a few days passed. One day the princess designed
to put some oil in her hair, and comb it; just as she opened the plaits
of her hair a pearl round and brilliant dropped out. The princess gave
it to the hermit, and desired him to sell it in the city, and bring her
the amount. He sold that pearl, and brought back the money received for
it to the princess. Then the princess desired that a habitation fit for
her residence might be erected on that spot. The hermit replied,
&lsquo;O daughter, do you dig the foundation for the walls, and collect
some earth; I will, some of these days, bring some water, knead the
clay [for the bricks], and erect a room for you.&rsquo; The princess,
on his advice, began to dig the ground; when she had dug a yard in
depth, behold, under the soil a door appeared. The princess cleared
away the earth [which lay before it]; a large room filled with jewels
and gold pieces appeared: she took four or five handfuls of gold and
closed the door, and having filled up the place with earth, made level
its surface. In the meantime the hermit returned. The princess said to
him, &ldquo;bring good masons and builders, and workmen of every kind,
expert and masters in their craft, so that a grand palace may be
erected on this spot equal to the palace of
<i>Kasr&#257;&#803;</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4147src" href=
"#xd26e4147" name="xd26e4147src">33</a> and superior to the palace of
<i>Ni&rsquo;m&#257;n</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4161src" href=
"#xd26e4161" name="xd26e4161src">34</a> and that the fortifications of
the city, a fort, a garden, a well, and an unrivalled caravanserai [be
built as soon as possible]; but first <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4172" href="#xd26e4172" name="xd26e4172">129</a>]</span>of all,
draw out the plans on paper and bring them to me for
approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hermit brought clever, skilful, intelligent workmen, and
had them ready. The erection of the different buildings was soon begun
according to the princess&rsquo;s directions, and clever and trusty
servants for every office were chosen and entertained. The news of the
erection of such princely buildings by degrees reached the king, the
shadow of Omnipotence, who was the princess&rsquo;s father. On hearing
it, he became greatly surprised, and asked every one, &lsquo;Who is
this person who has begun to erect such edifices?&rsquo; No one knew
anything of the matter to be able to give a reply. All put their hands
on their ears and said, &lsquo;No one of your slaves knows who is the
builder of them.&rsquo; Then the king sent one of his nobles with this
message, <span class="corr" id="xd26e4176" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&lsquo;</span>I wish to come and see those buildings,
and to know also of what country you are the princess, and of what
family; for I wish much to ascertain all these
circumstances.<span class="corr" id="xd26e4179" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When the princess received this agreeable intelligence, she
was greatly pleased in her mind, and wrote the [following letter]:
&lsquo;To the protector of the world, prosperity! On hearing the
intelligence of your majesty&rsquo;s visit, to my humble mansion, I am
infinitely rejoiced; and it has been the cause of respect and dignity
to me, the meanest [of your slaves]. How happy is the fate of that
place where your majesty&rsquo;s footsteps are impressed, and on the
inhabitants of which the shadow of the skirt of your prosperity is
cast; may they both be dignified with the look of favour! This slave
hopes that to-morrow, being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4185"
href="#xd26e4185" name="xd26e4185">130</a>]</span>Thursday, is a
propitious day, and to me, it is more welcome than the day of <i>Nau
Roz</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4190src" href="#xd26e4190" name=
"xd26e4190src">35</a> your majesty&rsquo;s person resembles the sun; by
condescending to come here, be pleased to bestow, with your light,
value and dignity on this worthless atom, and partake of whatever his
humble slave can provide; this will be the essence of benevolence and
courtesy, on the part of your majesty: to say more would exceed the
bounds of respect.<span class="corr" id="xd26e4193" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> To the nobleman who brought the
message she made some presents, and dismissed him [with the above
reply.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king read the letter, and sent word, saying, &lsquo;We
have accepted your invitation, and will certainly come.&rsquo; The
princess ordered the servants and all the attendants to get ready the
necessary preparations for an entertainment, with such propriety and
elegance, that the king, on seeing [the banquet] and eating thereof,
might be highly pleased; and that all who came with the king, great and
little, should be well entertained and return content. From the
princess&rsquo;s strict directions, the dishes, of every kind, both
salt and sweet, were so deliciously prepared, that if the daughter of a
<i>Br&#257;hman</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4200src" href=
"#xd26e4200" name="xd26e4200src">36</a> had tasted them, she would have
become a <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4209src"
href="#xd26e4209" name="xd26e4209src">37</a> When the evening came, the
king went to the princess&rsquo;s palace, seated on an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4221" href="#xd26e4221" name=
"xd26e4221">131</a>]</span>uncovered throne; the princess, with her
ladies in waiting, advanced to receive him; when she cast her eyes on
the king&rsquo;s throne, she made the royal obeisance with such proper
respect, that on seeing it, the king was still more surprised; with the
same profound respect she accompanied the king to the throne, set with
jewels, which she had erected for him. The princess had prepared a
platform of 125,000 pieces of silver;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4223src" href="#xd26e4223" name="xd26e4223src">38</a> a hundred
and one trays of jewels and of gold pieces, and woollen shiffs, shawls,
muslins, silk and brocades; two elephants and ten horses, of
<i>&rsquo;&#298;r&#257;k</i> and <i>Yaman</i>, with caparisons set with
precious stones, were likewise prepared [for the royal acceptance]. She
presented these to his majesty, and stood before him herself with
folded arms. The king asked with great complacency, &lsquo;Of what
country are you a princess, and for what reasons are you come
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The princess, after making her obeisance, replied,
&lsquo;This slave is that offender who in consequence of the royal
anger was sent to this wilderness, and all these things which your
majesty sees are the wonderful works of God.&rsquo; On hearing these
words, the king&rsquo;s blood glowed (with paternal warmth), and rising
up, he pressed the princess fondly to his bosom, and seizing her hand,
he ordered her to be seated on a chair that he had placed near the
throne; but still the king was astonished and surprised [at all he
saw], <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4247" href="#xd26e4247" name=
"xd26e4247">132</a>]</span>and ordered that the queen, along with the
princesses, should come thither with all speed. When they arrived, the
mother and sisters recognised [the princess], and, embracing her with
fondness, wept over her, and praised God. The princess presented her
mother and sisters with such heaps of gold and jewels, that the
treasures of the world could not equal them in the balance. Then the
king, having made them all sit in his company, partook of the feast
[which had been prepared].</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as the king lived, the time passed in this manner;
sometimes the king came [to visit the princess], and sometimes carried
the princess with him to his own palaces. When the king died, the
government of the kingdom descended to this princess; for, except
herself, no other person [of her family] was fit for this office. O,
youth, the history [of the princess] is what you have heard. Finally,
heaven-bestowed wealth never fails, but the intentions of the possessor
must [at the same time] be just; moreover, how much soever is spent
[out of this providential wealth] so much also is the increase: to be
astonished at the power of God, is not right in any religion.&rdquo;
The female servant, after finishing this narrative, said, &ldquo;Now if
you still intend to proceed to the country of <i>N&#299;mroz</i>, and
if you are determined in your mind to bring the requisite intelligence,
then depart soon.&rdquo; I replied, I am going this moment, and if God
pleases I shall be back very soon. At last, taking leave [of the
princess] and relying on the protection of God, I set out for that
quarter.</p>
<p>In about a year&rsquo;s time, after encountering many <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4256" href="#xd26e4256" name=
"xd26e4256">133</a>]</span>difficulties, I arrived at the city of
<i>N&#299;mroz</i>. All the inhabitants of that place that I saw, noble
or common, were dressed in black, and whatever I had heard, that I
fully perceived. After some days the evening<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4261src" href="#xd26e4261" name="xd26e4261src">39</a> of the new
moon occurred. On the first day of the month, all the inhabitants of
the city, little and great, children, nobles, prince, women and men,
assembled on a large plain. I also, bewildered and distracted in my
condition, went along with the vast concourse; separated from my
country and possessions, in the garb of a pilgrim, I was standing to
behold the strange sight, and to see what might result from the
mysterious scene. In the meantime, a young man advanced from the woods,
mounted on a bull, foaming at the mouth, and roaring and shouting [in a
frightful manner]. I, miserable, who had undergone such labour, and
overcome so many dangers, and had come there to ascertain the
circumstances, yet on seeing the young man I was quite confounded and
stood silent with astonishment. The young man, according to his usual
custom, did what he used to do, and returned [to the woods]; and the
concourse of people from the city likewise returned thither. When I had
collected my senses, I then repented [saying to myself], &ldquo;What is
this you have done? Now it is your lot to wait anxiously for another
whole month.&rdquo; Having no remedy, I returned with the rest; and I
passed that month like the month of <i>Ramaz&#803;an</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4275src" href="#xd26e4275" name=
"xd26e4275src">40</a> counting one day <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4284" href="#xd26e4284" name="xd26e4284">134</a>]</span>after
another. At last the new moon appeared, and was hailed by me as
<i>&rsquo;&#298;d</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4289src" href=
"#xd26e4289" name="xd26e4289src">41</a> On the first of the month, the
king and the inhabitants again assembled on that same plain; then I
determined, that this time, let what will happen, I would be resolute,
and propound this mysterious circumstance.</p>
<p>Suddenly the young man appeared, mounted, according to custom, on a
yellow bull, and, dismounting, sat down [on the ground]; in one hand he
held a naked sword, and in the other the bull&rsquo;s halter; he gave
the vase to his attendant, who, as usual, showed it to every one, and
carried it back [to his master]. The crowd, on seeing the vase, began
to weep; the young man broke the vase, and struck such a blow on the
slave&rsquo;s neck as to sever his head from his body, and, he himself
remounting the bull, returned [towards the woods]. I began to run after
him, with all speed, but the inhabitants laid hold of my hand, and
exclaimed, &ldquo;What is this you are going to do? why, knowingly, art
thou about to perish? If thou art so tired of life, there are a great
many ways of dying, by which thou mayest end thy existence.&rdquo; How
much soever I beseeched them [to let me go], and even had recourse to
main force, in order that by some means I might escape from their
hands, yet I could not release myself. Three or four men clung fast to
me, and having seized me, led me towards the city. I again suffered for
another whole month in a strange state of disquietude. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4309" href="#xd26e4309" name=
"xd26e4309">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>When that month passed also, and the last day of it had elapsed, all
the inhabitants assembled on the plain on the following morning in the
same manner. I, apart from all, arose at the hour of [morning] prayer.
I went before all the others [were astir] into the woods, and there lay
concealed, exactly on the road by which the young man was to pass; for
no one could there restrain me [from executing my project]. The young
man came in the usual manner, performed the same acts [already
described], re-mounted, and was returning. I followed him, and eagerly
running up, I joined him. The young man, from the noise of my steps,
perceived that some body was coming after him. All at once, turning
round the halter of his bull, he gave a loud shout, and threatened me;
then drawing his sword, he advanced towards me, and was about to
strike. I bent down with the utmost respect, and made him my
<i>sal&#257;m</i>, and joining both my hands together, I stood in
silence. That person being a judge of respectful behaviour [restraining
his blow], said to me. &ldquo;O pilgrim, thou wouldest have been killed
for nothing, but thou hast escaped&mdash;thy life is prolonged; get
away. Where art thou going?&rdquo; He then drew a jewelled dagger,
having a tassel set with pearls, from his waist, and threw it towards
me, and added, &ldquo;At this moment I have no money about me to give
thee; carry this [dagger] to the king, and thou wilt get whatever thou
askest.&rdquo; To such a degree did my fear and dread of him prevail,
that I had not power to speak or ability to move; my voice was choked,
and my feet became heavy.</p>
<p>After saying this, the brave young man, roaring <span class=

"xd26e4317">136</a>]</span>aloud, went on. I said to myself, &ldquo;let
what will happen, to remain behind now is, in thy case, folly thou wilt
never again get such an opportunity [to execute thy project].
Regardless, therefore, of my life,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4319src"
href="#xd26e4319" name="xd26e4319src">42</a> I also went on. He again
turned round and forbade me in great wrath [to follow him], and seemed
determined to put me to death. I stretched forth my neck, and conjuring
him [by all that was sacred], I said, &ldquo;<i>O Rustam</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4324src" href="#xd26e4324" name=
"xd26e4324src">43</a> of these days, strike such a blow that I may be
cut clean in two; let not a fibre remain together, and let me be
released from this wandering and wretched state; I pardon you my
blood.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;O demon-faced! why dost thou for
nothing bring thy blood on my head, and makest me criminal; go thy own
way; what! is thy life become a burden to thee?&rdquo; I did not mind
what he said, but advanced; then he knowingly appeared not to regard
me, and I followed him. Proceeding on about two <i>kos</i>, we passed
the wood, and came to a square building; the young man went up to the
door and gave a frightful scream; the door opened of itself; he
entered, and I remained altogether outside. O God, [said I] what shall
I now do? I was perplexed; at last, after a short delay, a slave came
out and brought a message, saying, &ldquo;Come in, he has called you to
his presence; perhaps the angel of death hovers over your head; what
evil fortune has befallen you?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Verily it is
good fortune;&rdquo; and without fear, I entered along with him into
the garden. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4335" href="#xd26e4335"
name="xd26e4335">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last, he led me to a place where [the young man was sitting]; on
seeing him, I made him a very low<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4338src"
href="#xd26e4338" name="xd26e4338src">44</a> <i>sal&#257;m</i>; he
beckoned me to sit down; I sat down with respect. What do I see but the
young man sitting alone on a <i>masnad</i>, with the tools of a
goldsmith lying before him; and he had just finished a branch of
emeralds. When the time came for him to rise up, all the slaves that
were around the place concealed themselves in [different] rooms; I also
from fear hid myself in a small closet. The young man rose up, and
having fastened the chains of all the apartments, he went towards the
corner of the garden, and began to beat the bull he usually rode. The
noise of the animal&rsquo;s roaring reached my ear, and my heart quaked
[with fear]; but as I had ran all these risks to develop this mystery,
I forced the door, though trembling with fear, and under the screen of
the trunk<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4353src" href="#xd26e4353" name=
"xd26e4353src">45</a> of a tree, I stood and saw [what was going on].
The young man threw down the club with which he was beating [the bull],
and unlocked a room and entered it. Then, instantly coming out, he
stroked the bull&rsquo;s back with his hand, and kissed its mouth; and
having given it some grain and grass, he came towards me. On perceiving
this, I ran off quickly, and hid myself in the room.</p>
<p>The young man unfastened the chains of all the rooms, and the whole
of the slaves came out, bringing with them a small carpet, a wash-hand
basin, and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4367" href="#xd26e4367"
name="xd26e4367">138</a>]</span>water pot. After washing his hands and
face, he stood up to pray; when he had finished his prayers, he called
out, &ldquo;Where is the pilgrim?&rdquo; On hearing myself called, I
ran out and stood before him; he desired me to sit down; after making
him a <i>sal&#257;m</i>, I sat down; the dinner was served; he partook
of it, and gave me some, which I also ate. When the dishes were
removed, and we had washed our hands, he dismissed his slaves and told
them to go to rest. When no one [except ourselves] remained in the
apartment, he then spoke to me, and asked, &ldquo;O friend, what great
misfortune has befallen thee that thou goest about seeking thy
death?&rdquo; I related in full detail all the adventures of my life,
from beginning to end, and added, that, &ldquo;from your goodness, I
have hopes of obtaining my wishes.&rdquo; On hearing this, he heaving a
deep sigh, went raving mad, and began to say, &ldquo;O God! who except
thee is acquainted with the tortures of love! He whose chilblain has
not yet broken out, how can he know the pains of others? he only knows
the degree of this pain who has felt the pangs of love!</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;The anguish of love, you must ask of the
lover,</p>
<p class="line">Not of him who feigns, but of the true
lover.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">A moment after, coming to himself, he heaved a
heart-burning sigh; the room resounded with it; then I perceived that
he was likewise tortured with the pangs of love, and was suffering from
the same malady [as myself]. On this discovery, I plucked up courage
and said, &ldquo;I have related to you all my own adventures; now do me
the favour to impart to me the past <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4380" href="#xd26e4380" name="xd26e4380">139</a>]</span>events
[of your life]; I will then first of all assist you as far as I can,
and by exerting myself obtain for you the desires of your heart.&rdquo;
In short, that true lover, conceiving me his companion and
fellow-sufferer, began the relation of his adventures in the following
manner. &ldquo;Hear, O friend! I whose heart is tortured with anguish,
am the prince of this country of <i>N&#299;mroz</i>; the king, that is
to say, my father, at my birth, collected together all the fortune
tellers, astrologers and learned men, and ordered them to cast and
examine my horoscope, to fix my nativity, and to state in full to his
majesty whatever was to befall me every individual moment, and hour,
and <i>pahar</i>, and day, and month, and year, [of my life]. They all
assembled according to the king&rsquo;s order, and consulting together,
they, from their mystical science, ascertained my future fate, and
said, &lsquo;By the blessing of God, the prince has been begotten and
born under such a propitious planet, and in such a lucky moment, that
he ought to be equal to Alexander in extent of dominion, and in justice
equal to <i>Naush&#299;rw&#257;n</i>. He will be, moreover, proficient
in every science, and every [branch of] learning, and towards whatever
subject his heart is inclined, he will accomplish it with perfection.
He will in generosity and bravery acquire such renown, that mankind
will no longer remember <i>H&#803;&#257;tim</i> and <i>Rustam</i>; but
until [he attains] the age of fourteen, he is exposed to great danger
if he sees the sun or moon; yea, it is to be feared he may become a mad
demoniac, and shed the blood of many; and restless [of living in
society], he will fly to the woods, and associate with beasts and
birds; great and strict pains must be taken that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4398" href="#xd26e4398" name=
"xd26e4398">140</a>]</span>should never behold the sun by day or the
moon by night, or cast a look even towards the heavens. If this period
[of fourteen years] pass away without danger and in safety, then for
the rest of his life he will reign in peace and prosperity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing this [prognostication], the king ordered this
garden to be laid out, and caused to be built in it many apartments of
various kinds. He gave an order for me to be brought up in a vault,
lined [on the inside] with felt, so that not a single ray of light from
the sun or moon might penetrate [into my apartment]. I had a wet nurse
and all other kinds of female servants and attendants attached to me,
and was brought up in this grand palace with this [imagined] security.
A learned tutor, who was skilled in public affairs, was appointed to
[superintend] my education; so that I might acquire every science and
art, and the practice of the seven varieties of penmanship; and my
father always looked after me; the occurrences of every day and every
moment were told to the king. I considered that same place as the whole
world, and amused myself with toys and flowers; and I had procured for
me every delicacy the world [could produce] for my food; whatever I
desired I had. By the age of ten years, I had acquired every species of
learning, and every useful accomplishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, beneath that dome, an astonishing flower appeared
from the sky-light, which increased in size as I gazed upon it; I
wished to seize it with my hands, but as I stretched them towards it,
it ascended [and eluded my grasp]. I, having become astonished, was
looking steadfastly at it, when the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4404" href="#xd26e4404" name="xd26e4404">141</a>]</span>sound of
a loud laugh reached my ear; I raised my head to look [towards the dome
from which the noise proceeded]. Then I saw that a face, resplendent as
the full moon, having rent the felt, continued issuing forth. On
beholding it, my reason and senses vanished. On coming to myself, I
looked up, and saw a throne of jewels raised on the shoulders of
fairies; a person was seated on it, with a crown of precious stones on
her head, and clothed in a superb dress; she held in her hand a cup
made of ruby, and seated, was drinking wine. The throne descended by
slow degrees from its height, and rested on [the floor of] the dome.
Then the fairy called me, and placed me beside her [on the throne]; she
began to make use of expressions of endearment, and having pressed her
lips to mine, she made me drink a cup of rosy wine, and said,
&lsquo;The human race is faithless, but my heart loves thee.&rsquo; The
expressions she uttered were so endearing and so fascinating, that in a
moment my heart was enraptured, and I felt such pleasure as if I had
tasted the supreme joys of life, and thus I conceived that I had only
on that day entered the world [of enjoyment].</p>
<p>&ldquo;The result is my present state! but no one [on earth] hath
ever seen, or heard such ecstatic pleasure! In that zest, with our
hearts at ease, we both were seated, when all at once our joys were
dashed to pieces! Now listen to the unlooked-for circumstance [which
produced this sudden change]. At the moment, four fairies descended
from the heavens, and whispered something in that beloved one&rsquo;s
ear. On hearing it, her colour changed, and she said to me,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4408" href="#xd26e4408" name=
"xd26e4408">142</a>]</span>&lsquo;O my beloved, I fondly wished to pass
some moments with you, and regale my heart, and to repeat my visits in
the same manner, or to take thee with me. But fate will not permit two
persons [like us] to remain in one place in peace and felicity;
farewell, my beloved! may God protect you!&rsquo; On hearing these
[dreadful words], my senses vanished, and my bliss fled from my
grasp.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4410src" href="#xd26e4410" name=
"xd26e4410src">46</a> I cried, &lsquo;O my charmer, when shall we meet
again? what dreadful words of wrath are these which you have made me
hear? If you will return quickly, then you will find me alive,
otherwise you will regret the delay; or else tell me your name and
place of residence, that I may from those directions, by diligent
search, conduct myself to you.&rsquo; On hearing this she said,
&lsquo;God forbid [you should do so]; may the ears of Satan be deaf;
may your age amount to a hundred and twenty years;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e4413src" href="#xd26e4413" name="xd26e4413src">47</a> if we
live we shall meet again; I am the daughter of the king of the
<i>Jinns</i>, and I dwell in the mountain of

"#xd26e4429" name="xd26e4429src">48</a> On saying this, she caused the
throne to ascend,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4454src" href="#xd26e4454"
name="xd26e4454src">49</a> and it ascended in the same manner as it had
descended. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4487" href="#xd26e4487"
name="xd26e4487">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Whilst the throne was in sight, our eyes were fixed on each
other; when it disappeared from my eyes, my state became such as if the
shadow of a fairy had fallen on me; a strange sort of gloom was spread
over my heart, and my understanding and consciousness left me; the
world appeared dark under my eyes; distracted and confused, I wept
bitterly, and scattered dust over my head, and tore my clothes; I
became regardless of food and drink, nor cared for good or evil.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;What various evils result from this same
love!</p>
<p class="line">In the heart are produced sadness and
impatience.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4495src" href=
"#xd26e4495" name="xd26e4495src">50</a></p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;My misfortune was soon known to my nurse and
preceptor; with fear and trembling they went before the king, and said,
&lsquo;Such is the state of the prince of the people of the world; we
do not know how this disaster has suddenly and of itself fallen upon
him, so that rest, food, and drink have all [on his part] been
abandoned.&rsquo; [On hearing these sad tidings] the king immediately
came to the garden [where I resided], accompanied by the
<i>waz&#299;r</i>, intelligent nobles, wise physicians, true
astrologers, learned <i>mull&#257;s</i>, holy devotees, and men
abstracted from worldly affairs. On seeing my distracted, sighing,
weeping condition, his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4514" href=
"#xd26e4514" name="xd26e4514">144</a>]</span>mind became also
distracted; he wept, and with fond affection clasped me to his breast,
and gave orders for my proper treatment. The physicians wrote out their
prescriptions, in order to strengthen my heart and cure my brain, and
the holy priests wrote out charms<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4516src"
href="#xd26e4516" name="xd26e4516src">51</a> and amulets, some to be
swallowed, and others to be worn on my person, and having each repeated
prayers [of exorcism], they began to blow upon me; the astrologers said
this misfortune had happened owing to the revolution of the stars [for
the averting] of it, give pious donations. In short, every one advised
according to his science; but what was passing within me, my heart
alone experienced; no one&rsquo;s assistance or remedy was of avail to
my evil destiny; day after day my lunacy increased, and my body became
emaciated from the want of nourishment. There remained for me only to
shriek and moan, day and night. Three years passed away in this state.
In the fourth year, a merchant, who was on his travels, arrived, and
brought with him into the royal presence rare and valuable articles of
different countries; he met with a gracious reception. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4534" href="#xd26e4534" name=
"xd26e4534">145</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The king favoured him greatly, and after inquiries respecting
his health, he said to him, &lsquo;You have seen many countries; have
you anywhere seen a truly learned physician, or have heard of such from
any one?&rsquo; The merchant replied, &lsquo;Mighty sire, this slave
has travelled a great deal; in the middle of the [Ganges] river in
<i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i> there is a small mountain; there a
<i>Ja&#7789;a-dh&#257;r&#299; Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4542src" href="#xd26e4542" name=
"xd26e4542src">52</a> has built a large temple to
<i>Mah&#257;dev</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4554src" href=
"#xd26e4554" name="xd26e4554src">53</a> together with a place of
worship, and a garden of great beauty, and in that [mountain-island] he
lives; and his custom is this, that once a year on the day of
<i>Shevr&#257;t</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4566src" href=
"#xd26e4566" name="xd26e4566src">54</a> he comes out of his dwelling,
swims in the river, and enjoys himself. After washing himself, when he
is returning to his abode, then the sick and afflicted of various
countries and regions, who come there from afar, assemble near his
door. Of these a numerous crowd is formed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The holy <i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> (who
ought to be called the Plato<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4582src" href=
"#xd26e4582" name="xd26e4582src">55</a> of these days), moves along
examining the urine, and feeling the pulse of each, and giving each a
recipe. God has given him such healing power, that, on taking his
medicines, their effects are instantaneous, and the disease utterly
vanishes. These circumstances I have seen with my own eyes, and adored
the power of God which has created such beings! If your <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4588" href="#xd26e4588" name=
"xd26e4588">146</a>]</span>majesty orders it, I will conduct the prince
of the people of the world to that [wonderful man], and show the prince
to him; I firmly hope he will soon be completely cured; moreover, this
scheme is externally beneficial, for from inhaling the air of various
places, and from the diet and drink of different countries [through
which we shall pass], the prince&rsquo;s mind will be restored to
cheerfulness.&rsquo; The merchant&rsquo;s advice seemed very proper to
the king, and being pleased, he said, &lsquo;Very well; perhaps the
holy man&rsquo;s treatment may prove efficacious, and this melancholy
may be removed from my son&rsquo;s mind.&rsquo; The king appointed a
confidential nobleman, who had seen the world, and had been tried on
[various] occasions, together with the merchant, to attend me, and he
furnished us with the requisite equipment. Having seen us embark on
boats of every variety, together with our baggage, he dismissed us.
Proceeding onwards, stage after stage, we arrived at the place [where
the holy <i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> lived]. From change of air, and
from living on a different diet, my mind became somewhat composed; but
there still remained the same state of silence; and I wept incessantly.
The recollection of the lovely fairy was not for a moment effaced from
my mind; if I spoke sometimes, it was only to repeat these
lines:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;I know not what fairy-faced one has glanced over
me,</p>
<p class="line">But my heart was sound and tranquil not long
ago.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">At last, when two or three months had passed away,
nearly four thousand sick had assembled on the rock, and all said,
&lsquo;If God please, the <i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> will shortly
come out of his abode, and bestow on us his advice, and we shall be
perfectly cured.&rsquo; In short, when that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4603" href="#xd26e4603" name=
"xd26e4603">147</a>]</span>day arrived, the
<i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> appeared in the morning, like the sun,
and bathed and swam in the river; he crossed over it and returned, and
rubbed ashes of cow-dung over his body, and hid his fair form like a
live coal under the ashes. He made a mark with sandal wood on his
forehead, girded on his <i>langot&#299;</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4611src" href="#xd26e4611" name="xd26e4611src">56</a> threw a
towel over his shoulders, tied his long hair up in a knot, twisted his
mustachios, and put on his shoes. It appeared, from his looks, that the
whole world possessed no value to him. Having put a small writing desk
set with gems under his arm, and looking at each [patient] in turn, he
gave them his recipes, and came to me. When our looks met, he stood
still, paused for a moment, and then said to me, &lsquo;Come with
me.&rsquo; I went along with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had done with all the rest, he led me into the
garden, and into a neat and richly-ornamented private apartment, and he
said to me, &lsquo;Do you make your residence here,&rsquo; and went
himself to his abode. When forty days had elapsed, he came to me, and
found me better comparatively with [what I had been] before. He then,
smiling, said, &lsquo;Amuse yourself by walking about in this garden,
and eat whatever fruits you like.&rsquo; He gave me a china pot filled
with <i>ma&rsquo;j&#363;n</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4626src"
href="#xd26e4626" name="xd26e4626src">57</a> and added, &lsquo;Take
without fail six <i>m&#257;sh&#257;s</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4639src" href="#xd26e4639" name="xd26e4639src">58</a> from this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4648" href="#xd26e4648" name=
"xd26e4648">148</a>]</span>pot every morning, fasting.&rsquo; Saying
this, he went away, and I followed strictly his prescription. My body
perceptibly gained strength daily, and my mind composure, but mighty
love was still triumphant; that fairy&rsquo;s form ever wandered before
my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day I perceived a book<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4652src" href="#xd26e4652" name="xd26e4652src">59</a> in a recess
in the wall; I took it down, and saw that all the sciences relating to
the future and the present world were comprised in it, as if the ocean
had been compressed into a vase. I used to read it at all times; I
acquired great skill in the science of physic, and the mystical art of
philters. A year passed away in the meantime, and again that same day
of joy returned; the <i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i>, having arisen from
his devotional posture, came out [of his abode]; I made him my
<i>sal&#257;m</i>; he gave me the writing case, and said,
&lsquo;Accompany me.&rsquo; I [accordingly] went along with him. When
he came out of the gate a vast crowd showered blessings on him. The
nobleman and the merchant, seeing me with the
<i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i>, fell at his feet, and began to pour
forth their blessings on him, saying, &ldquo;by the favour of your
holiness, this much at least has been effected.&rdquo; The
<i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> went to the <i>g&#863;h&#257;&#7789;</i>
of the river, according to custom, and performed his ablutions and
devotions, as he was wont to do every year; returning [from thence], he
was proceeding along the line and examining the sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened, that in the group of lunatics, a handsome young
man, who had scarce strength to stand up, attracted the
<i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;&rsquo;s</i> attention. He said to me,
&lsquo;Bring him with you.&rsquo; After delivering his prescriptions
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4676" href="#xd26e4676" name=
"xd26e4676">149</a>]</span>of cure to all, he went into his private
apartment and opened a little of the young lunatic&rsquo;s skull; he
attempted to seize with his forceps the centipede which was curled on
his brain. An idea struck me, and I spoke out, saying, &lsquo;If you
will heat the forceps in the fire, and then apply it to the
centipede&rsquo;s back, it will be better, as it will then come out of
its own accord; but if you thus attempt to pull it off, it will not
quit its grasp on the brain, and [the patient&rsquo;s] life will be
endangered.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4678src" href=
"#xd26e4678" name="xd26e4678src">60</a> On hearing this, the
<i>Gus&#257;,&#299;&#7749;</i> looked towards me; silently he rose up,
and, without saying a word, he went to the corner of the garden, and
seizing a tree in his grasp, he formed his long hair into a noose, and
hanged himself. I went to the spot, and saw, alas! alas! that he was
dead. I became quite afflicted at the strange and astonishing sight;
but being helpless, I thought it best to bury him. The moment I began
to take him down from the tree, two keys dropt from his locks; I took
them up, and interred that treasure of excellence in the earth. Having
taken with me the two keys, I began to apply them to all the locks. By
chance I opened the locks of two rooms with these keys, and perceived
that they were filled from the floor to the roof with precious stones;
in one place I saw a chest covered with velvet, with clasps of gold,
and locked. When I opened it, then I saw in it a book, in which was
written the &ldquo;Most awful of Names,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4684src" href="#xd26e4684" name="xd26e4684src">61</a> and the
mode of invoking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4699" href=
"#xd26e4699" name="xd26e4699">150</a>]</span>the genii, and the
fairies, and the holding of intercourse with spirits, and how to subdue
them, also the mode of charming the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I became quite delighted at the idea of having acquired such
a treasure, and began to put those [charms] in practice. I opened the
garden door, and said to the nobleman, and to those who had come with
me, &lsquo;Send for the vessels which had brought us, and embark in
them all these jewels, specie, merchandise, and books,&rsquo; and
having embarked myself in a small vessel, I proceeded from thence to
the main ocean. When sailing along, I approached my own country. The
intelligence reached my father. He mounted his horse, and advanced to
meet us; with anxious affection he clasped me to his bosom; I kissed
his feet, and said, &lsquo;May this humble being be allowed to live in
the former garden?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king replied, &lsquo;O my son, that garden appears to me
calamitous, and I have therefore forbidden its being kept up; that spot
is not at present fit for the abode of man; reside in any other abode
which your heart may desire. You had best choose some place in the
fort, and live under my eyes; and having there formed such a garden as
you wish, continue to walk about and to amuse yourself.&rsquo; I
strenuously resisted and caused the former garden to be repaired once
more, and having embellished it like a perfect paradise, I went to
reside in it. There, at my ease, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4705" href="#xd26e4705" name="xd26e4705">151</a>]</span>fasted
forty days for the purpose of subduing the <i>jinns</i> to my will; and
having abandoned living creatures, I began to practise [my spells] on
the world of spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the forty days were completed, such a terrible storm
arose at midnight, that the very strongest buildings fell down, and
trees were uprooted and scattered in all directions; an army of fairies
appeared. A throne descended from the air, on which a person of
dignified appearance was seated, richly dressed, with a crown of pearls
on his head. On seeing him, I saluted him with great respect; he
returned my salutation, and said, &lsquo;O friend, why hast thou raised
this commotion for nothing? what dost thou want with me?&rsquo; I
replied, &lsquo;This wretch has been long in love with your daughter,
and for her I have every where wandered about wretched, distracted, and
am dead, though alive; I am now sick of existence, and have staked my
life on this deed which I have done. All my hopes now rest on your
benevolence, that you will exalt this unfortunate wanderer with your
favour, and that you will bestow on me life and happiness, by allowing
me to behold [your fair daughter]; it will be an act of great
merit.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4712src" href="#xd26e4712"
name="xd26e4712src">62</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing my wishes he said, &lsquo;Man is made of earth,
and we are formed of fire; connection between two such [classes] is
very difficult.&rsquo; I swore an oath, saying, &lsquo;I only desire to
see her, and have no other purpose.&rsquo; Again the king [of the
fairies] replied, &lsquo;Man does not adhere to his promises; in time
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4720" href="#xd26e4720" name=
"xd26e4720">152</a>]</span>need he promises everything, but he does not
keep it in recollection. I say this for thy good; for if ever thou
formest other wishes, then she and thou wilt be ruined and undone;
moreover, it will endanger your lives.&rsquo; I repeated my oaths, and
added, that whatever could injure both of us, I would never do, and
that all I desired was to see her sometimes. These words were passing
[between us], when suddenly, the fairy (of whom we were talking)
appeared before us, with much splendour, and completely adorned; and
the throne of the king [of the fairies] remounted thence. I then
embraced the fairy with fond eagerness, and repeated this
verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Why should not she of the arched eyebrows come
[to my house],</p>
<p class="line">She for whose sake I have fasted for forty
days.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">In that state of felicity we resided together in the
garden. I dreaded through fear to think of other joys; I only tasted
the superficial pleasure [of her roseate lips], and constantly gazed
upon her charms. The lovely fairy, seeing me so true to my oath, was
surprised within herself, and used sometimes to say, &lsquo;O my
beloved, you are indeed strictly faithful to your promise; but I will
give you, by the way of friendship, a piece of advice; take care of
your mystical book; for the <i>jinns</i>, seeing you off your guard,
will purloin it some day or other.&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I guard
this book as I would my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so happened, that one night Satan led me astray; in a fit
of overpowering passion, I said to myself, &lsquo;Let happen what will,
how long can I restrain myself?&rsquo; I clasped the [lovely fairy] to
my bosom, and attempted to revel in ecstatic joys. Instantly, a voice
came forth, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4734" href="#xd26e4734"
name="xd26e4734">153</a>]</span>saying, &lsquo;Give me the book, for
the great name of God is written in it; do not profane it.&rsquo; In
that fervour of passion, I was insensible [to every other
consideration]; I took the book from my bosom and delivered it, without
knowing to whom I gave it, and plunged myself into the fervid joys of
love. The beautiful fairy, seeing my foolish conduct, said,
&lsquo;Alas! selfish man, thou hast at last transgressed, and forgotten
my admonition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On saying this, she became senseless, and I perceived a
<i>jinn</i> standing at the head of the bed, who held the magical book
in his hand; I attempted to seize him, and beat him severely, and
snatch away the book, when in the meantime another appeared, took the
book from his hand, and ran off. I began to repeat the incantations I
had learnt. The <i>jinn</i>, who was still standing near me, became a
bull; but, alas! the lovely fairy had not in the least recovered her
senses, and that same state of stupor continued. Then my mind became
distracted, and all my joys were turned into bitterness. From that day,
man became my aversion. I live in a corner of this garden; and for the
sake of agreeably occupying my mind, I made this emerald vase,
ornamented with flowers, and every month I go to the plain, mounted on
that same bull, break the vase, and kill a slave, with the hope that
every one may see my sad state and pity me; perhaps some creature of
God may so far favour me and pray for me, that I even may regain the
desire [of my heart]. O faithful friend, such as I have related to thee
is the sad tale of my madness and lunacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wept at hearing it, and said, &ldquo;O prince, you have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4747" href="#xd26e4747" name=
"xd26e4747">154</a>]</span>truly suffered greatly from love; but I
swear here by God, that I will abandon my own wishes, and will now roam
among woods and mountains for your good, and do all I can [to find out
your beloved fairy]. Having made this promise, I took leave of the
prince, and for five years wandered through the desert, sifting the
dust, like a mad man, but found no trace [of the fairy]. At last,
desponding of success, I ascended a mountain, and wished to throw
myself down [from its summit], so that neither bone nor rib [in my
frame] might remain entire. The same veiled horseman, [who saved you
from destruction], came up to me and said, &ldquo;Do not throw away thy
life; in a few days thou wilt be in possession of the desires of thy
heart.&rdquo; O holy <i>Darweshes</i>! I have at last seen you. I have
now hopes that joy and happiness will be our lot, and all of us, now
affected as we are, may attain our wished-for objects. <span class=

in the language would say, &ldquo;Here a distinction seems to be drawn
between the words <i>zab&#257;n</i> and <i>j&#299;bh</i>. Both signify
&lsquo;tongue,&rsquo; but the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3418"
href="#xd26e3418" name="xd26e3418">102n</a>]</span>former applies to
men and the latter to animals.&rdquo; To this profound bit of criticism
I should reply&mdash;Not so fast, Mr. Novice; a distinction there is,
but that is not it. The word <i>zab&#257;n</i> in Persian and
<i>Hindust&#257;n&#299;</i> means both the fleshy member of the body,
called the tongue, and also language or speech, just like our word
&ldquo;tongue,&rdquo; which has both significations. In the former
sense it applies alike to man and beast; in the latter it is mere
truism to say that it applies to man only. <i>J&#299;bh</i>, in
<i>Hind&#299;</i> and <i>Hindust&#257;n&#299;</i>, means the tongue
only in the sense of the member of the body, never in the sense of
speech; hence it is equally applicable to man or brute. Ask any
physician who has practised in India the <i>Hindust&#257;n&#299;</i>
for &ldquo;show the tongue,&rdquo; he will tell you <i>j&#299;bh
dikl&#257;,o</i>, or <i>zab&#257;n dikla,o</i>; and if he was a man of
discernment, he would use <i>j&#299;bh</i> with a <i>Hind&#363;</i>,
and <i>zab&#257;n</i> with a <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>; but I believe he
would be perfectly understood, whichever word he used to either
party.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e3410src">&uarr;</a></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the second <i>Darwesh</i> had likewise finished
telling the relation of his adventures, the night ended, and the time
of morning was just beginning. The king, <i>&#256;z&#257;d
Bak&#863;ht</i>, silently proceeded towards his own kingly abode. On
arriving at his palace, he said his prayers. Then, having gone to the
bathing-house, and dressed himself superbly, he proceeded to the
<i>D&#299;w&#257;ni &rsquo;&#256;mm</i> and mounted his throne; and he
issued an order, saying, &ldquo;Let a messenger go and bring along with
him, with respect, to our presence, four <i>Darweshes</i> who have
[recently<span class="corr" id="xd26e4770" title="Source: [">]</span>
arrived at such a place.&rdquo; The messenger went there according to
orders, and perceived that the four <i>Darweshes</i>, after performing
the necessary calls, and washed their hands and faces, were on the
point of setting out on [their peregrinations], and take their
different roads. The messenger said to them, &ldquo;Reverend sirs, the
king has called you four personages; come along with me.&rdquo; The
four <i>Darweshes</i> began to stare at each other, and said to the
messenger, &ldquo;Son, we are the monarchs of our own hearts; what have
we to do with a king of this world?&rdquo; The messenger answered,
&ldquo;Holy sirs, there is no harm in it, and it is better you should
go.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4780" href="#xd26e4780"
name="xd26e4780">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>The four <i>Darweshes</i> then recollected that what <i>Maul&#257;
Murtaz&#803;&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4788src" href=
"#xd26e4788" name="xd26e4788src">1</a> had said to them, that same had
now come to pass; they were pleased at the recollection<a id=
"xd26e4794" name="xd26e4794"></a>, and went along with the messenger.
When they reached the fort and went before the king, the four
<i>&#7730;alandars</i> gave a benediction, saying, &ldquo;Son, may it
be well with thee.&rdquo; The king then retired to the
<i>D&#299;w&#257;ni k&#863;ha&#7779;&#7779;</i>, and having called two
or three of his confidential nobles near him, he ordered the four
<i>Darweshes</i> to be brought in. When they went there [before his
majesty], he commanded them to sit down, and asked them their
adventures, saying, &ldquo;From whence come you, where do you intend to
go, and where is the residence of your worships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They replied, &ldquo;May the king&rsquo;s age and wealth be
always on the increase! we are <i>Darweshes</i>, and have in this very
manner for a long while wandered and roamed about; we bear our homes on
our shoulders. There is a saying, that &lsquo;a pilgrim&rsquo;s home is
where the evening overtakes him;&rsquo; and all we have seen in this
versatile world is too long a tale to relate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> gave them every confidence and
encouragement, and having sent for refreshment, he made them breakfast
before him. When they finished [their meal] the king said to them,
&ldquo;Relate all your adventures to me, without the least reserve;
whatever services I can render you, I will not fail to do.&rdquo; The
<i>Darweshes</i> replied that, &ldquo;whatever has happened to us, we
have not the strength to relate, nor will any pleasure result to the
king from hearing it; therefore <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4818" href="#xd26e4818" name="xd26e4818">157</a>]</span>pardon
us.&rdquo; The king then smiled, and said, &ldquo;Where you were
sitting on your couches last night and relating each his own
adventures, there I was likewise present; moreover, I have heard the
adventures of two of you; I now wish that the two who remain would also
relate theirs; and stay with me a few days in perfect confidence, for
&lsquo;the footsteps of the <i>Darwesh</i> scare away
evil.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4823src" href=
"#xd26e4823" name="xd26e4823src">2</a> On hearing these words from the
king, they began to tremble in consequence of their fear; and having
hung down their heads, they remained silent&mdash;they had not the
power to speak.</p>
<p>When <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> perceived that now through
fear their senses no longer remained with them, so as to enable them to
tell anything, he said [to revive their spirits] &ldquo;There is no
person in this world to whom rare and strange incidents have not
occurred; although I am a king, yet I have even seen strange scenes,
which I will first of all relate to you [to inspire you with confidence
and remove your fears]; do you listen to it with your minds at
ease,&rdquo; The <i>Darweshes</i> replied, &ldquo;O king, peace be on
thee! such are your kindnesses towards us darweshes, condescend to
relate them.&rdquo; <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> began his
adventures, and said,</p>

<p class="first">When my father died, and I ascended the throne, it was
in the very season of youth, and all this kingdom of <i>R&#363;m</i>
was under my dominion. It happened one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4851" href="#xd26e4851" name="xd26e4851">158</a>]</span>year,
that some merchant from the country of
<i>Badak&#863;hsh&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4855src" href=
"#xd26e4855" name="xd26e4855src">3</a> came [to my capital] and brought
a good deal of merchandise. The reporters of intelligence<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4866src" href="#xd26e4866" name="xd26e4866src">4</a>
sent notice to me to this effect, that so considerable a merchant had
never visited our city before: I sent for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came, and brought with him the rarities of every country,
which were worthy of being offered to me, as presents. Indeed, every
article appeared to be of inestimable value; above all, there was a
ruby in a box, of an exceedingly fine colour, very brilliant, perfect
in shape and size, and in weight [amounting to] five
<i>mis&#804;&#7731;&#257;ls</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4874src"
href="#xd26e4874" name="xd26e4874src">5</a> Though I was a king, I had
never seen such a precious stone, nor had I heard of such from any
other person. I accepted it, and bestowed upon the merchant many
presents and honours; I gave him passports for the roads, that
throughout my empire no one should ask him any duties; that they should
treat him with kindness wherever he went; that he should be waited on,
and have guards for his protection, and that they should consider any
loss he might experience as their own. The merchant attended at the
time of audience, and was well versed in the forms of respect due to
royalty; his conversation and eloquence were worth hearing. I used to
send for the ruby daily from the jewel office, and look at it at the
time of public audience. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4886" href=
"#xd26e4886" name="xd26e4886">159</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day I was seated in the <i>d&#299;w&#257;ni &rsquo;&#257;mm,</i>
and the nobles and officers of state were in waiting in their
respective places, and the ambassadors of different sovereigns, who had
come to congratulate me [on my accession to the throne], were likewise
present. I then sent for the ruby, according to custom; the officer of
the jewel office brought it; I took it in my hand and began to praise
it, and gave it to the ambassador of the Franks [to look at it]. On
seeing it, he smiled, and praised it by way of flattery; in the same
manner it passed from hand to hand, and every one looked at it, and all
said together, &ldquo;The preponderance of your majesty&rsquo;s good
fortune has procured you this; for otherwise, even unto this day, no
monarch has ever acquired so inestimable a jewel.&rdquo; At that moment
my father&rsquo;s <i>waz&#299;r</i>, who was wise, and held the same
station under me, and was standing in his place, made his obeisance and
said, &ldquo;I wish to impart something [to the royal ear], if my life
be granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ordered him to speak; he said, &ldquo;Mighty sire, you are king,
and it is very unbecoming in kings to laud so highly a stone; though it
is unique in colour, in quality, and in weight, yet it is but a stone;
and at this moment the ambassadors of all countries are present in the
court; when they return to their respective countries, they will
assuredly relate this anecdote, saying, &lsquo;What a strange king he
is, who has got a ruby from somewhere, and makes such a rarity of it,
that he sends for it every day, and praising it himself the first,
shows it to every one present.&rsquo; Then whatever king or
<i>r&#257;j&#257;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e4899src" href=
"#xd26e4899" name="xd26e4899src">6</a> hears this anecdote, the same
will certainly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4916" href=
"#xd26e4916" name="xd26e4916">160</a>]</span>laugh at it in his own
court. Great sire, there is an insignificant merchant in
<i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4921src" href=
"#xd26e4921" name="xd26e4921src">7</a> who has twelve rubies, each
weighing seven <i>mis&#804;&#7731;&#257;ls</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4942src" href="#xd26e4942" name="xd26e4942src">8</a> which he has
sewed on a collar, and put it round his dog&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo; On
hearing this, I became greatly displeased, and said with anger, put
this <i>waz&#299;r</i> to death.</p>
<p>The executioners immediately seized hold of his hands, and were
going to lead him out [to execution]. The ambassador of the king of the
Franks, joining his hands [in humble supplication] stood before me. I
asked him what he wanted; he replied, &ldquo;I hope I may become
informed of the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> fault,&rdquo; I answered,
what can be a greater fault than to lie, especially before kings. He
replied, &ldquo;His falsehood has not yet been confirmed; perhaps what
he has said may be true; now, to put an innocent person to death is not
right.&rdquo; I said to him in reply, &ldquo;It is not at all
consistent with reason, that a merchant, who, for the sake of gain,
wanders disconsolate from city to city and from country to country, and
hoards up every farthing [he can save], should sew twelve rubies, which
weigh seven <i>mis&#804;&#7731;&#257;ls</i> each, on the collar of a
dog.&rdquo; The ambassador in answer said, &ldquo;Nothing is surprising
before the power of God; perhaps it may be the case; such rarities
often fall into the hands of merchants and pilgrims. For these two
[classes of people] go into every country, and they bring away with
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4960" href="#xd26e4960" name=
"xd26e4960">161</a>]</span>whatever they find rare in [their travels].
It is most advisable for your majesty to order the <i>waz&#299;r</i> to
be imprisoned, if he is as guilty [as you suppose]; for
<i>waz&#299;rs</i> are the intelligencers of kings, and such conduct as
this appears unhandsome in the latter, that in a case, the truth and
falsehood of which is as yet unascertained, to order them to be put to
death, and that the services and fidelity of a whole life should be
forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty sire, former kings have erected prisons for this very
reason, that when the kings or chiefs may be in wrath towards any one,
then they might confine him. In a few days their anger will have
entirely subsided, and [the suspected one&rsquo;s] innocence will
become manifest, and the king will be exempt from the stain of shedding
innocent blood, and not have to answer for it on the day of
judgment.&rdquo; Though I wished ever so much to refute him, yet the
ambassador of the Franks<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4970src" href=
"#xd26e4970" name="xd26e4970src">9</a> gave such just replies, that he
reduced me to silence. Then I said, well, I agree to what you say, and
I pardon him his life. But he shall remain imprisoned; if in the space
of a year his words are proved to be true, that such rubies are round
the neck of a dog, then he shall be released; otherwise, he shall be
put to death with many torments. I accordingly ordered the
<i>waz&#299;r</i> to be carried to prison. On hearing this order, the
ambassador made me his humble obeisance,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4976src" href="#xd26e4976" name="xd26e4976src">10</a> and
performed his parting salute. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4979"
href="#xd26e4979" name="xd26e4979">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>When this news reached the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> family, weeping
and lamentations took place, and it became a house of mourning. The
<i>waz&#299;r</i> had a daughter of the age of fourteen or fifteen
years, very handsome and accomplished, perfect in writing and reading.
The <i>waz&#299;r</i> loved her greatly, and was extremely fond of her;
so much so, that he had erected an elegant apartment for her behind his
own <i>d&#299;w&#257;n k&#863;h&#257;na;</i> and had procured for her
the daughters of noblemen as her companions, and handsome female
servants waited on her; with these she passed her time in laughter and
joy, and playing and romping about.</p>
<p>It happened that on the day the <i>waz&#299;r</i> was sent to
prison, the girl was sitting with her young companions, and was
celebrating with [infantile] pleasure the marriage of her doll; and
with a small drum and timbrel she was making preparation for the night
vigils; and having put on the frying pan, she was busy making up
sweetmeats, when her mother suddenly ran into her apartment, lamenting
and beating [her breasts], with dishevelled tresses and naked feet. She
struck a blow on her daughter&rsquo;s head, and said, &ldquo;Would that
God had given me a blind son instead of thee; then my heart would have
been at ease, and he would have been the friend of his father.&rdquo;
The <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter asked, &ldquo;What use would a
blind son have been to you? whatever he could do, I can do
likewise.&rdquo; The mother replied, &ldquo;Dust be on thy head! such a
calamity hath fallen on thy father, that he is confined in the prison
for having used some improper expressions before the king.&rdquo; The
daughter asked, &ldquo;What were the expressions? let me hear
them.&rdquo; Then her mother <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5002"
href="#xd26e5002" name="xd26e5002">163</a>]</span>answered, &ldquo;Your
father said that there is a merchant in <i>Nish&#257;p&#363;r</i>, who
has fixed twelve inestimable rubies on his dog&rsquo;s collar: the king
would not believe him, but conceived him a liar, and has imprisoned
him. If he had had to-day a son, he would have exerted himself by every
means to ascertain the truth of the circumstance; he would have
assisted his father, besought the king&rsquo;s forgiveness, and have
got my husband released from prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter said [in reply], &ldquo;O
mother, we cannot combat against fate; man under sudden calamity ought
to be patient, and place his hopes in the bounty of God. He is
merciful, and does not hold any one&rsquo;s difficulties to be
irremovables; weeping and lamentations are improper. God forbid that
our enemies should misrepresent [the motive of our tears] to the king,
and the teller of tales calumniate us, for that would be the cause of
farther displeasure. On the contrary, let us offer up our prayers for
the king&rsquo;s welfare; we are his born slaves, and he is our master;
even as he is wroth, so will he be gracious.&rdquo; The girl, from her
good sense, thus made her mother comprehend these things, so that she
became somewhat patient and tranquil, and returned in silence to her
palace. When the night arrived, the
<i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5014src"
href="#xd26e5014" name="xd26e5014src">11</a> sent for her foster
father, [or nurse&rsquo;s husband], and fell at his feet and beseeched
him greatly, and weeping, said, &ldquo;I have formed a resolution to
wipe off the reproach my mother has cast on me, so that my father may
regain his freedom. If you will be my companion, then I will set out
for <i>Niash&#257;p&#363;r</i>, and having seen the merchant [who has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5020" href="#xd26e5020" name=
"xd26e5020">164</a>]</span>such rubies round his dog&rsquo;s neck], I
will do all in my power [to the end that] I may release my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man indeed made some excuses at first; at length after much
discussion, he agreed [to her request]. Then the
<i>wazir-z&#257;d&#299;</i> said, &ldquo;Make the preparations for the
Journey in secrecy and silence, and buy some articles of trade fit to
be presented as offerings to kings, and procure as many slaves and
servants as may be required; but do not let this circumstance be
revealed to any one.&rdquo; The foster father agreed [to the project],
and set about [the necessary] preparations. When all the materials were
got ready, he loaded the camels and mules, and set out; the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter also put on the dress of a man, and
joined him. No one in the house knew anything whatever [of the
departure]. When the morning came, it was mentioned in the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> family, that the
<i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i>, had disappeared, and that it was
uncertain where she was gone.</p>
<p>At last, the mother, from fear of scandal, concealed the
circumstance of her daughter&rsquo;s disappearance; and there [on the
journey] the <i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i> gave herself out as a
&ldquo;young merchant.&rdquo; Travelling onwards stage by stage, they
arrived at <i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>; and with great pleasure they
went and put up at the <i>caravan-serai</i> and unloaded all their
merchandise. The <i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i> I remained there that
night; in the morning she went to the bath; and put on a rich dress,
according to the costume of the inhabitants of <i>R&#363;m</i>, and
went out to ramble through the city. Proceeding along, she reached the
<i>chauk,</i> and stood where the four great streets crossed each
other; and a jeweller&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5057"
href="#xd26e5057" name="xd26e5057">165</a>]</span>shop appeared on one
side, where a great deal of jewels were exposed [for sale], and slaves
wearing rich dresses were in waiting, with crossed arms; and a man, who
was their chief, of about fifty years<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5059src" href="#xd26e5059" name="xd26e5059src">12</a> of age,
dressed like rich persons in a short-sleeved jacket, was seated there,
with many elegant companions near him, seated likewise on stools, and
conversing among themselves.</p>
<p>The <i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i> (who had represented herself as
a merchant&rsquo;s son,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5079src" href=
"#xd26e5079" name="xd26e5079src">13</a>) was greatly surprised at
seeing the jeweller; and, on reflection, she became pleased in her own
heart, saying, &ldquo;God grant this be no delusion! it is most
probable that this is the very merchant, the anecdote of whom my father
mentioned to the king. O, great God, enlighten me as to his
circumstances.&rdquo; It happened, that on looking around her, she saw
a shop, in which two iron cages were suspended, and two men were
confined in them. They looked like <i>majn&#363;n</i> in appearance,
only skin and bones remained; the hair of their heads and their nails
were quite overgrown, and they sat with their heads reclined on their
breasts; two ugly negroes, completely armed, were standing on each side
[of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5091" href="#xd26e5091"
name="xd26e5091">166</a>]</span>cages]. The young merchant was struck
with amazement, and exclaimed, &ldquo;God bless us.&rdquo; When she
looked round the other way, she saw another shop, where carpets were
spread, on which an ivory stool was placed, with a velvet cushion, and
a dog sat thereon, with a collar set with precious stones around his
neck, and chained by a chain of gold; and two young handsome servants
waited on the dog. One was shaking [over him] a
<i>morchhal</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5095src" href="#xd26e5095"
name="xd26e5095src">14</a> with a golden handle, set with precious
stones, and the other held an embroidered handkerchief in his hand,
with which he [from time to time] wiped the dog&rsquo;s mouth and feet.
The young merchant, having looked at the animal with great attention,
perceived on its collar the twelve large rubies, as she had heard [them
described]. She praised God, and began to consider thus: &ldquo;By what
means can I carry those rubies to the king, and show them to him, and
get my father released?&rdquo; She was plunged in these perplexing
reflections; meanwhile, all the people in the square and on the road,
seeing her beauty and comeliness, were struck with astonishment, and
remained utterly confounded. All the people said one to another,
&ldquo;Even unto this day, we have never seen a human being of this
form and beauty.&rdquo; The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5109src" href="#xd26e5109" name=
"xd26e5109src">15</a> also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5115"
href="#xd26e5115" name="xd26e5115">167</a>]</span>perceived her, and
sent a slave, saying, &ldquo;Go thou and entreat that young merchant to
come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slave went up to her and delivered his master&rsquo;s message,
and said, &ldquo;If you will have the kindness, then my master is
desirous of [seeing] your honour; pray come and have an interview with
him.&rdquo; The young merchant indeed wished this very thing, and said
in reply, &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5119src"
href="#xd26e5119" name="xd26e5119src">16</a> The moment she came near
the <i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i>, and he had a full view of her, the dart
of attachment pierced his breast; he rose up to receive her
respectfully, but his senses were utterly bewildered. The young
merchant perceived that &ldquo;now he is entangled in the net&rdquo;
[of my charms]. They mutually embraced one another; the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> kissed the young merchant&rsquo;s
forehead, and made him sit down near him; and asked with much kindness,
&ldquo;inform me of your name and lineage? whence have you come, and
where do you intend to go?&rdquo; The young merchant replied,
&ldquo;This humble servant&rsquo;s country is <i>R&#363;m</i>, and
Constantinople has been for ages the birth-place [of my ancestors.] My
father is a merchant; and as he is now from old age unable to travel
[from country to country on his mercantile concerns] on this account he
has sent me abroad to learn the affairs of commerce. Until now I had
not put my foot out of our door; this is the very first journey that
has occurred to me. I had not courage<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5131src" href="#xd26e5131" name="xd26e5131src">17</a> to come
here by sea, I therefore travelled by land; but your excellence and
good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5138" href="#xd26e5138" name=
"xd26e5138">168</a>]</span>name is so renowned in this country of
<i>&rsquo;Ajam</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5142src" href=
"#xd26e5142" name="xd26e5142src">18</a> that to have the pleasure only
of meeting you I have come so far. At last, by the favour of God, I
have had the honour of [sitting in] your noble presence, and have found
your good qualities exceed your renown; the wish of my heart is
accomplished; God preserve you in safety, I will now set out from
hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these [last words], the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;aja&rsquo;s</i>
mind and senses were quite discomposed, and he exclaimed, &ldquo;O, my
son, do not speak to me of such a thing;&rdquo; stay some days with me
in my humble abode; pray tell me where are your goods, and your
servants?&rdquo; The young merchant replied, &ldquo;The
traveller&rsquo;s abode is the <i>sar&#257;,e</i>;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5158src" href="#xd26e5158" name="xd26e5158src">19</a> leaving
them there, I came to see you.&rdquo; The
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> said, &ldquo;It is unbecoming [a person
of your consideration] to dwell in the <i>sar&#257;,e</i> I have some
reputation in this city, and much celebrity; send quickly for your
baggage, &amp;c.; I will prepare a house for your goods; let me see
whatever commodities you have brought; I will so manage it, that you
will get here great profit on them. At the same time, you will be at
your ease, and saved the danger and fatigue [of travelling any farther
for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5185" href="#xd26e5185" name=
"xd26e5185">169</a>]</span>market], and by staying with me a few days
you will greatly oblige me.&rdquo; The young merchant
pretended<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5187src" href="#xd26e5187" name=
"xd26e5187src">20</a> to make some excuses, but the
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> would not accept them, and ordered one of his
agents, saying, &ldquo;Send quickly some burden-bearers, and bring the
goods, &amp;c., from the <i>caravanserai</i> and lodge them in such a
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young merchant likewise sent a slave of his own with [the agent]
to bring the property and merchandise; and he himself remained with the
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> until the evening. When the time of [the
afternoon] market had elapsed, and the shop was shut, the
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> went towards his house. Then one of the two
slaves took the dog up under his arm, and the other took up the stool
and carpet; and the two negro slaves placed the two cages on the heads
of porters, and they themselves, accoutred with the five
weapons,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5204src" href="#xd26e5204" name=
"xd26e5204src">21</a> went alongside of them. The
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> took hold of the young merchant&rsquo;s hand,
and conversing with him, reached his house.</p>
<p>The young merchant saw that the house was grand, and fit for kings
or nobles [to reside in]. Carpets were spread on the border of a
rivulet, and before the <i>masnad</i> the different articles for the
entertainment were laid out. The dog&rsquo;s stool was placed there
also, and the <i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> and young merchant took their
seats; he presented to him some wine without ceremony; they both began
to drink. When they got merry, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>
called for dinner; the <i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;n</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5224src" href="#xd26e5224" name=
"xd26e5224src">22</a> was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5230"
href="#xd26e5230" name="xd26e5230">170</a>]</span>spread, and the good
things of the world were laid out. First they put some meat in a dish,
and having covered it with a cover of gold, they carried it to the dog,
and having spread an embroidered <i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;n</i>,
they laid the dish before him. The dog descended from his stool, ate as
much as he liked, and drank some water out of a golden bowl, then
returned and sat on his stool. The slaves wiped his mouth and feet with
a napkin, and then carried the dish and bowl to the two cages, and
having asked for the keys from the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>, they
opened the locks.</p>
<p>They took out the two men [who were confined in the cages], gave
them many blows with a great stick, and made them eat the leavings of
the dog and drink the same water; they again fastened the doors [of the
cages] and returned the keys to their master. When all this was over,
the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> began to eat himself. The young
merchant was not pleased at these circumstances, and did not touch the
victuals from disgust. How much soever the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> pressed him, yet he flatly refused. Then
the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> asked the reason of this, saying,
&ldquo;Why do you not eat?&rdquo; The young merchant replied,
&ldquo;This conduct of yours appears disgusting to me, for this reason
that man is the noblest of God&rsquo;s creatures, and the dog is
decidedly impure. So to make two of God&rsquo;s own creatures eat the
leavings of a dog, in what religion or creed is it lawful? Do not you
think it sufficient that they are your prisoners? otherwise they and
you are equal. Now, I doubt if you are a <i>Musulm&#257;n</i>; who
knows what you are? Perhaps you worship the dog; it is disgusting to me
to eat your dinner, until this doubt is removed from my mind.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5253" href="#xd26e5253" name=
"xd26e5253">171</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> answered, &ldquo;O, son, I
comprehend perfectly all that you say, and am generally censured for
these reasons; for the inhabitants of this city have fixed upon me the
name of dog-worshipper, and call me so, and have published it
[everywhere]; but may the curse of God alight on the impious and the
infidel!&rdquo; The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> then repeated the
<i>kalima</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5265src" href="#xd26e5265"
name="xd26e5265src">23</a> and set the young merchant&rsquo;s mind at
ease. Then the young merchant asked, thus, &ldquo;If you are really a
<i>Musalm&#257;n</i> in your heart, then what is the reason of this? By
so acting, get yourself generally censured?&rdquo; The
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> said in reply, &ldquo;O, son, my name is
reprobated, and I pay double taxes in the city, that no one may know
this secret [motive of my conduct]. It is a strange circumstance,
which, whoever hears, will get nothing by the recital but grief and
indignation. You must likewise pardon me [from relating it]; for I
shall not have strength of mind to recount it, nor will you have the
composure of mind to listen to it.&rdquo; The young merchant thought
within himself, &ldquo;I have only to mind my own business; why should
I to no purpose press him further on the subject?&rdquo; <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5278" title="Source: she">She</span> accordingly
replied to the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>, &ldquo;Very well; if it
is not proper to be related, do not mention it.&rdquo; He then began to
partake of the dinner, and having lifted a morsel, began to eat. The
space of about two months<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5284src" href=
"#xd26e5284" name="xd26e5284src">24</a> the young merchant passed with
the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>, with such prudence and
circumspection, that no one found out by any chance that he was a woman
[in disguise]. All thought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5299"
href="#xd26e5299" name="xd26e5299">172</a>]</span>that this
[individual] was a male, and the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i>
affection for him increased daily, so that he could not allow him to be
a moment absent from his sight.</p>
<p>One day, in the midst of a drinking feat, the young merchant began
to weep. On seeing it, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> comforted
her, and began to wipe away his tears with his handkerchief, and asked
him the cause of his weeping. He answered, &ldquo;O, father, what shall
I say? would to God that I had never attained access to your presence,
and that your worship had never shown me that kindness which you are
shewing. I am now distressed between two difficulties; I have no heart
to be separated from your presence, nor is there a possibility of my
staying here. Now, it is necessary for me to go; but in separating from
you, I do not perceive hopes of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>
involuntarily wept so loudly, that he was nearly choked, and exclaimed,
&ldquo;O, light of my eyes! are you so soon tired of your old friend,
that you think of going away and leaving him in such affliction? banish
from your heart the idea of departing; as long as I have to live,
remain here; I shall not live a day in your absence, and must [in such
case] die before my appointed hour. The climate of this kingdom of
Persia is very fine and congenial [to your health], you had best
despatch a confidential servant, and send for your parents and property
here; I will furnish whatever equipages and conveyances you require;
when your parents and all their household come here, you can pursue
your commercial concerns at your ease. I also have in my life gone
through many hardships, and have wandered <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5315" href="#xd26e5315" name="xd26e5315">173</a>]</span>many
countries. I am now old and have no issue; I love you dearer than a
son, and make you my heir and head manager. Be you, on the other hand,
careful and attentive to my concerns. Give me a bit of bread to eat
whilst I live; when I die, be pleased to bury me, and then take
[possession of] all my wealth and effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the young merchant replied, &ldquo;It is true, you have,
more than a father, shewn to me kindness and affection, so that I have
forgotten my parents; but this humble culprit&rsquo;s father only
allowed a year&rsquo;s leave; if I exceed it, then he in his extreme
old age will weep himself to death; finally, a father&rsquo;s
approbation is meritorious before God, and if mine should be displeased
with me, then I fear he may curse me, and I shall be an outcast from
God&rsquo;s grace in this world and the next. Now such is your
worship&rsquo;s kindness, that you will give me leave to obey my
father&rsquo;s commands, and fulfil the duties [of a son] towards a
parent; I shall, while life lasts, bear on my neck the gratitude I owe
for your kindness. If I am ever [so fortunate as] to reach my native
country, I will still ever think of your goodness with my heart and
soul. God is the Causer of causes; perhaps some such cause may again
occur, that I may have occasion to pay you my respects. In short, the
young merchant urged such persuasive and feeling arguments to the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>, that he, poor man, being helpless,
yielded to their force.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5322src" href=
"#xd26e5322" name="xd26e5322src">25</a> Inasmuch as he was now
completely fascinated, he began to say in reply, &ldquo;Well, if you
will not stay here, I will myself go with you. I consider <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5325" href="#xd26e5325" name=
"xd26e5325">174</a>]</span>you equivalent to my own life: hence, if my
life goes with you, of what use is a lifeless body? If you are
determined to go, then proceed, and take me with you.&rdquo; Saying
this to the young merchant, he began his preparations likewise for the
journey, and gave orders to his agents to get ready quickly the
necessary conveyances.</p>
<p>When the news of the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i>
departure became public, the merchants of that city on hearing it,
began likewise their preparations to set out with him. The
dog-worshipping <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> took with him specie and
jewels to a great amount, servants and slaves without number, and rich
rarities and property worthy of a king, and having pitched his tents of
various sorts outside of the city, he went to them. All the other
merchants took articles of merchandise with them according to their
means, and joined the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>; they became for
themselves a [regular] army.</p>
<p>One day, having fixed on a lucky moment for departure, they set out
thence on their journey. Having laden thousands of camels with canvas
sacks filled with goods, and the jewels and specie on mules<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5340" title="Not in source">,</span> five hundred
slaves from the steppes of <i>&#7730;apch&#257;&#7731;</i>, from
<i>Zang</i>, and from <i>R&#363;m</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5352src" href="#xd26e5352" name="xd26e5352src">26</a> completely
armed, men used to the sword, mounted on horses of Arabia, of Tartary,
and of <i>Ir&#257;k</i>, accompanied [the caravan]. In the rear of all
came the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> and the young merchant, richly
dressed, and mounted on sedans; a rich litter was lashed on the back of
a camel, in which the dog reposed on a cushion, and the cages of the
two prisoners were slung one on each side of another, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5362" href="#xd26e5362" name=
"xd26e5362">175</a>]</span>across a camel, and thus they marched
onwards. At every stage they came to, all the merchants waited on the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> and on his
<i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;n</i> they ate of his food and drank of
his wine. The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> offered up his grateful
thanks to the Almighty for the happiness of having the young merchant
with him, and proceeded on, stage by stage. At last, they reached the
environs of Constantinople in perfect safety, and encamped without the
city. The young merchant said [to the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>],
&ldquo;O, father, if you grant me permission, I will go and see my
parents, and prepare a house for you, and when it is agreeable to you,
you will be pleased to enter the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> replied, &ldquo;I am come so far
for your sake, well, go quickly and see [your parents], and return to
me, and give me a place to live in near your own.&rdquo; The young
merchant having taken leave [of the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>],
came to his own house. All the people of the household of the
<i>waz&#299;r</i> were surprised, and exclaimed, &ldquo;What man has
entered [the house]!&rdquo; The young merchant, that is, the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter, ran and threw herself at her
mother&rsquo;s feet, and wept and said, &ldquo;I am your child.&rdquo;
On hearing this, the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> wife began to reproach
her, by saying, &ldquo;O, wanton girl, thou <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5395" title="Source: has">hast</span> greatly dishonoured
thyself; thou hast blackened thine own face, and brought shame on thy
family; we had imagined thee lost, and, after weeping for thee, had
with resignation given thee up; be gone hence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the <i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i> threw the turban off her
head and said, &ldquo;O, dear mother<span class="corr" id="xd26e5403"
title="Not in source">,</span> I did not go to an improper place, and
have done nothing wrong; I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5406" href="#xd26e5406" name="xd26e5406">176</a>]</span>contrived
the whole of this scheme according to your wishes to release my father
from prison. God be praised, that through the good effect of your
prayers, and through His grace, I, having accomplished the entire
object, am now returned; I have brought that merchant with me from
<i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>, along with the dog (around whose neck are
those rubies), and have returned with the innocence you
bestowed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5411src" href="#xd26e5411" name=
"xd26e5411src">27</a> on me. I assumed the appearance of a man for the
journey; now one day&rsquo;s work remains; having done that, I will get
my father released from prison, and return to my home; if you give me
leave, I will go back again, and remain abroad another day, and then
return to you.&rdquo; When the mother thoroughly comprehended that her
daughter had acted the part of a man, and had preserved herself in all
respects pure and virtuous, she offered up her grateful acknowledgments
to God, and, rejoicing [at the event], clasped her daughter to her
bosom and kissed her lips; she prayed for her and blessed her, and gave
her leave to go, saying, &ldquo;Do what thou thinkest best, I have full
confidence in thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>waz&#299;r-z&#257;d&#299;</i> having again assumed the
appearance of a man, returned to the dog-worshipping
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>. He had been in the meantime so much
distressed at her absence, that through impatience he had left his
encampment. It so happened, that as the young merchant was going out in
the vicinity of the city, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> was coming
from the opposite direction; they met each other in the middle of the
road. On seeing him, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> exclaimed,
&ldquo;O, my child! leaving <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5428"
href="#xd26e5428" name="xd26e5428">177</a>]</span>this old man by
himself, where wast thou gone?&rdquo; The young merchant answered,
&ldquo;I went to my house with your permission, but the desire I had to
see you again would not allow me to remain [at home], and I am returned
to you.&rdquo; They perceived a shady garden close to the gate of the
city on the sea shore; they pitched their tents and alighted there. The
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> and the young merchant sat down
together, and began to eat their <i>kab&#257;bs</i>, and drink their
wine. When the time of evening arrived, they left their tents, and sat
out on high seats to view the country. It happened that a royal
chasseur passed that way; he was astonished at seeing their manners and
their encampment, and said to himself, &ldquo;Perhaps the ambassador of
some king is arrived;&rdquo; he stood [and amused himself by] looking
on.</p>
<p>One of the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> messengers called
him forward, and asked him who he was. He replied, &ldquo;I am the
king&rsquo;s head chasseur.&rdquo; The messenger mentioned him to the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>, who ordered a negro slave, saying,
&ldquo;Go and tell the chasseur that we are travellers, and if he feels
inclined to come and sit down, the coffee and pipe are
ready.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5446src" href="#xd26e5446"
name="xd26e5446src">28</a> When the chasseur heard the name of
merchant, he was still more astonished, and came with the slave to the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> presence; he saw [on all sides]
the air of propriety and magnificence, and soldiers and slaves. To the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> and the young merchant he made his
salutations, and on seeing the dog&rsquo;s state and treatment, his
senses were confounded, and he stood like one amazed. The
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> asked <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5459" href="#xd26e5459" name="xd26e5459">178</a>]</span>him to
sit down, and presented him coffee; the chasseur asked the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> name and designation. When he
requested leave to depart, the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> having
presented him with some pieces [of cloth] and sundry rarities,
dismissed him. In the morning, when the chasseur attended the
king&rsquo;s audience, he related to those present the circumstances of
the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>; by degrees it came to my knowledge;
I called the chasseur before me, and asked about the merchant.</p>
<p>He related whatever he had seen. On hearing of the dog&rsquo;s
exalted state, and the two men&rsquo;s confinement in the cage, I was
quite indignant, and exclaimed, that reprobate of a merchant deserves
death! I ordered some of my executioners, saying, &ldquo;Go
immediately, and cut off and bring me the heretic&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
By chance, the same ambassador of the Franks was present at the
audience; he smiled, and I became still more angry, and said, &ldquo;O,
disrespectful; to display one&rsquo;s teeth<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5472src" href="#xd26e5472" name="xd26e5472src">29</a> without
cause in the presence of kings, is remote from good manners; it is
better to weep than laugh out of season.&rdquo; The ambassador replied,
&ldquo;Mighty sire, several ideas came across my mind, for which reason
I smiled; the first was, that the <i>waz&#299;r</i> had spoken truth,
and would now be released from prison; secondly, that your majesty will
be unstained with the innocent blood of the <i>waz&#299;r</i>; and the
third was, that the asylum of the universe, without cause or crime,
ordered the merchant to be put to death. At all these circumstances I
was surprised, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5484" href=
"#xd26e5484" name="xd26e5484">179</a>]</span>that without any inquiry
your majesty should, on the tale of an idle fellow, order people to be
put to death. God in reality knows what is the merchant&rsquo;s real
case; call him before the royal presence and inquire into his
antecedents; if he should be found guilty, then your majesty is master;
whatever treatment you please, that you can administer to him.</p>
<p>When the ambassador thus explained [the matter to me], I also
recollected what the <i>waz&#299;r</i> had said, and ordered the
merchant, together with his son, the dog, and the cages, to be brought
in my presence immediately. The messengers set off quickly [on the
errand], and in a short time brought them all. I summoned them before
me. First came the <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> and his son [the
young merchant], both richly dressed. All present were astonished and
bewildered on beholding the young merchant&rsquo;s extreme beauty; he
brought in his hand a golden tray, loaded with precious stones, (the
brilliancy of every one of which illuminated the room,) and laid it
before my throne, made his obeisance and stood [in respectful silence].
The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> also kissed the ground, and offered
up his prayers [for my prosperity]; he spoke with such sweet
modulation, as if he were the nightingale of a thousand melodies. I
greatly admired his elegant and decorous speech; but, assuming a face
of anger, I exclaimed, &ldquo;O, you Satan in human form! what net is
this that thou hast spread, and in thine own path what pit hast thou
dug? What is thy religion, and what rite is this I see? Of what
prophet&rsquo;s sect are thou a follower? If thou wast an infidel, even
then what sense is there in thy conduct? what is thy name, that thou
actest thus? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5497" href="#xd26e5497"
name="xd26e5497">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> calmly replied, &ldquo;May your
majesty&rsquo;s years and prosperity ever increase; this slave&rsquo;s
religious creed is this, that God is one: he has no equal, and I repeat
the confession of faith of <i>Muh&#803;ammad</i> the pure (the mercy of
God be shown to him and his posterity; may he be safe!) After him, I
consider the twelve <i>Im&#257;ms</i> as my guides; and my rite is
this, that I say the five regulated prayers and I observe fasts, and I
have likewise performed the pilgrimage, and from my wealth, I give the
fifth in alms, and I am called a <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>. But there is a
reason, which I cannot disclose, that I appear to possess all those bad
qualities which have raised your majesty&rsquo;s indignation, and for
which I am condemned by every one of God&rsquo;s creatures. Though I am
[ever so much] called a dog-worshipper, and pay double taxes, all this
I submit to; but the secrets of my heart I have not divulged to any
one.&rdquo; On hearing this excuse, my anger became greater, and I
said, thou art beguiling me with words; I will not believe them until
thou explainest clearly the reasons which have made thee deviate from
the right path, that my mind may be convinced of their truth; then thy
life will be saved; or else, as a retribution [for what thou hast
done], I will order thy belly to be ripped up, that the exemplary
punishment may deter others in future from transgressing the religion
of <i>Muh&#803;ammad</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> replied, &ldquo;O king, do not
spill the blood of this unfortunate wretch, but confiscate all the
wealth I have, which is beyond counting or reckoning, and having made
me and my son a votive offering to your throne, release us, and spare
us our lives.&rdquo; I smiled, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5520"
href="#xd26e5520" name="xd26e5520">181</a>]</span>and said, O fool!
dost thou exhibit to me the temptation of thy wealth? Thou canst not be
released, except thou speakest the truth. On hearing these words, the
tears streamed profusely from the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> eyes<a id="xd26e5525" name=
"xd26e5525"></a>; he looked towards his son and heaved a deep sigh, and
said [to him] &ldquo;I am criminal in the king&rsquo;s eyes; I shall be
put to death; what shall I do now? to whom shall I entrust thee?&rdquo;
I threatened him, and said, O dissembler! cease; thou hast made too
many excuses [already]; what thou hast to say, say it [quickly].</p>
<p>Then, indeed, that man having advanced forward, came near the throne
and kissed the foot of it, and poured forth my praise and eulogy, and
said, &ldquo;O king of kings, if the order for execution had not been
issued in my case, I would have borne every torture, and would not have
disclosed my story; but life is dear above every [consideration]; no
one of his own accord jumps into a well; to preserve life, then, is
right; and the abandoning of what is right is contrary to the mandates
of God. Well, if such is the royal pleasure, then be pleased to hear
the past events of this feeble old man. First, order the two cages, in
which the two men are confined, to be brought and placed before your
majesty. I am going to relate my adventures; if I falsify any
circumstance, then ask them to convict me, and let justice be
done.&rdquo; I approved of his proposal and sent for the cages, took
them both out, and made them stand near the
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> said, &ldquo;O king! this man,
who stands on the right hand of your slave is my eldest brother,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5537" href="#xd26e5537" name=
"xd26e5537">182</a>]</span>and he who stands on my left is my
second<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5539src" href="#xd26e5539" name=
"xd26e5539src">30</a> brother. I am younger than they; my father was a
merchant in the kingdom of Persia, and when I was fourteen years of
age, he died. After the burial ceremony was over, and the flowers had
been removed [from the corpse on the <i>Siyum</i>],<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e5545src" href="#xd26e5545" name="xd26e5545src">31</a> my two
brothers said to me one day, &lsquo;Let us now divide our
father&rsquo;s wealth, whatever there is, and let each do [with his
share] what he pleases.&rsquo; On hearing [this proposal], I said, O
brothers! what words are these! I am your slave, and do not claim the
rights of a brother. Our father, on the one hand, is dead, but you both
are alive and in the place of that father. I only want a dry loaf
[daily] to pass through life, and to remain alert in your service. What
have I to do with shares or divisions? I will fill my belly with your
leavings, and remain near you. I am a boy, and have not learnt even to
read or write? what am I able to do? At present do you confer
instruction upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing this, they replied, &lsquo;Thou wishest to ruin
and beggar us also along with thyself.&rsquo; I was silent, and retired
to a corner and wept; then I reasoned with myself and said, my
brothers, after all, are my elders; they are reproving [me for my good,
and] with a view to my education, that I may learn some [profession].
In these reflections I fell asleep. In the morning, a messenger from
the <i>&#7731;&#257;z&#803;&#299;</i> came and conducted me to the
court of justice; I saw that both <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5562" href="#xd26e5562" name="xd26e5562">183</a>]</span>my
brothers were there in waiting. The <i>&#7731;&#257;z&#803;&#299;</i>
asked me, &lsquo;Why dost not thou accept thy share of thy
father&rsquo;s property?&rsquo; I repeated to him what I had at home
said [to my brothers]. The latter said, &lsquo;If he speaks this
sentiment from his heart, then let him give us a deed of release,
saying he has no claims on our father&rsquo;s wealth and
property.&rsquo; Even then I thought, that as they both were my elders,
they advised for my good; that if I got my share of my father&rsquo;s
property I might improperly spend it. So, according to their desire, I
gave them a deed of release, with the
<i>&#7731;&#257;z&#803;&#299;&rsquo;s</i> seal. They were satisfied,
and I returned home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second day after this, they said to me, &lsquo;O brother,
we require the apartment in which you live; do you hire another place
for your residence, and go and stay there.&rsquo; &rsquo;Twas then I
perceived that they were not pleased that I should even remain in my
father&rsquo;s house; I had no remedy, and determined to leave it. O
protector of the world! when my father was alive, whenever he returned
from his travels, he used to bring the rarities of different countries,
and give them to me by way of presents; for this reason, that every one
loves most the youngest child. I from time to time sold these
[presents], and raised a small capital of my own; with this [sum] I
carried on some traffic. Once, my father brought for me a female slave
from Tartary, and he once brought thence some horses, from which he
gave me also a promising young colt; and I used to feed it from my own
little property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, seeing the inhumanity of my brothers, I bought a
house, and went and resided there; this dog <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5574" href="#xd26e5574" name=
"xd26e5574">184</a>]</span>also went along with me. I purchased the
requisite articles for housekeeping, and bought two slaves for
attendance; with the remainder of my capital I opened a shop as a cloth
merchant, and placing my confidence in God, I sat down quietly [in it],
and felt contented with my fate. Though my brothers had behaved
unkindly to me, yet, since God was gracious, my shop in three
years&rsquo; time increased so greatly, that I became a man of credit.
Whatever rarities [in the way of clothes or dresses] were required in
every great family, went from my shop only. I thereby earned large sums
of money, and began to live in affluent circumstances. Every hour I
offered up my prayers to the pure God, and lived at my ease; and often
used to repeat these verses on my [prosperous]
circumstances:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;Why should not the prince be displeased?</p>
<p class="line">I have nothing to do with him.</p>
<p class="line">Except thyself, O, mighty Prince,<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="line">Why should not my brother be displeased?</p>

<p class="line">Then to whom else should I go?</p>
<p class="line">Why should not the friend or foe be

<p class="line">During the whole [eight] watches,</p>
<p class="line">Let me fix my affections on thy feet only.</p>
<p class="line">Let the world be wrathful [with me],</p>
<p class="line">But thou dost far transcend [the world];</p>
<p class="line">All others may kiss my thumb,</p>
<p class="line">Only it is my wish that thou be not
displeased.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;It happened, that on a Friday I was sitting at
home, when a slave of mine had gone to the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> for
necessaries; after a short time, he returned in tears. I asked him the
reason, and what happened to him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5617" href="#xd26e5617" name="xd26e5617">185</a>]</span>He
replied with anger, &lsquo;What business is it to you? do you enjoy
yourself; but what answer will you give on the day of judgment?&rsquo;
I said, O, you Abyssinian, what demon has possessed thee? He answered,
&lsquo;This is the calamity, that the arms of your two elder brothers
have been tied behind their backs in the <i>chauk</i> by a Jew; he is
beating them with a whip, and laughs and says, &lsquo;If you do not pay
my money, I will beat you even unto the death [and if I lose my money
by the act], it will be at least a meritorious deed on my part.&rsquo;
Such is your brother&rsquo;s treatment, and you are indifferent; is
this right? and what will the world say?&rsquo; On hearing these
circumstances from the slave, my blood glowed<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5622src" href="#xd26e5622" name="xd26e5622src">33</a> [with
fraternal warmth]; I ran towards the <i>chauk</i> with naked feet, and
told my slaves to hasten with money. The instant I arrived there, I saw
that all that the slave had said was true; blows continued to fall on
my brothers. I exclaimed to the magistrate&rsquo;s guards, for
God&rsquo;s sake forbear awhile; let me ask the Jew what great fault
[my brothers] have committed, in retaliation for which, he so severely
punishes them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On saying this, I went up to the Jew and said, to-day is the
sabbath day;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5630src" href="#xd26e5630"
name="xd26e5630src">34</a> why dost thou continue to inflict stripes on
them? The Jew replied, &lsquo;If you wish to take their part, do it
fully, and pay me the money in their stead; or else take the road to
your house.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what is the amount? produce the bond,
and I will count thee out the money.&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;that he
had just given the bond to the magistrate.&rsquo; At this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5636" href="#xd26e5636" name=
"xd26e5636">186</a>]</span>moment, my slaves brought two bags of money.
I gave a thousand pieces of silver to the Jew, and released my
brothers. Such was their condition, naked, hungry, and thirsty, I
brought them with me to my own house, and caused them instantly to be
bathed in the bath, and dressed in new clothes, and gave them a hearty
meal. I never asked them what they had done with our father&rsquo;s
great wealth, lest they might feel ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O king, they are both present; ask them if I tell truth, or
falsify any of the circumstances. Well, after some space of time, when
they had recovered from the bruises of the beating [they had suffered],
I said to them one day, &lsquo;O brothers, you have now lost your
credit in this city, and it is better you should travel for some
days.&rsquo; On hearing this, they were both silent; but I perceived
they were satisfied [with my proposal]. I began to make preparations
for their journey, and having procured tents and all necessary
conveyance, I purchased for them merchandise to the amount of 20,000
rupees. A <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5642src"

href="#xd26e5651" name="xd26e5651src">36</a> I sent them along with
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a year, that caravan returned, but I heard no tidings
of my brothers; at last, putting a friend on his oath, I asked him
[what had become of them]. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5683"
href="#xd26e5683" name="xd26e5683">187</a>]</span>replied, &lsquo;When
they went to <i>Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#257;</i>, one of them lost all his
property at the gambling house, and is now a sweeper at the same house,
and keeps clean and plastered the place of gambling, and waits on the
gamblers who assemble there; they, by way of charity, give him
something, and he remains there as a scullion. The other brother became
enamoured of a <i>boza-vendor&rsquo;s</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5690src" href="#xd26e5690" name="xd26e5690src">37</a> daughter,
and squandered all his property [on her], and now he is one of the
waiters at the <i>boze-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5711src" href="#xd26e5711" name="xd26e5711src">38</a> The people
of the <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i> do not mention these circumstances to
you for this reason, that you would become ashamed [at hearing
them].</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing these circumstances from that person, I was in a
strange state; hunger and sleep vanished through anxiety; taking some
money for [the expenses of] the road, I set out instantly for
<i>Buk&#863;h&#257;r&#257;</i>. When I arrived there, I searched for
them both, and I brought them to the house [I had taken]. I had them
bathed and clothed in new dresses, and, from fear of their being
abashed with shame, I said not a word to them [of what had happened]. I
again purchased some goods for merchandise for them, and returned with
them home. When we arrived near <i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>, I left them
in a village with all the goods and chattels, and came [secretly] to my
house, for this reason, that no one might be informed of my return.
After two days, I gave out publicly that my brothers were returned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5729" href="#xd26e5729" name=
"xd26e5729">188</a>]</span>from their journey, and that I would go out
tomorrow to meet them. In the morning, as I wished to set out, a
peasant of that village came to me, and began to make loud complaints;
on hearing his voice I came out, and seeing him crying, I asked, why
dost thou make a lamentation? He answered, &lsquo;Our houses have been
plundered, owing to your brothers; would to God that you had not left
them there!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked, what misfortune has occurred? He replied, &lsquo;A
gang of robbers came at night and plundered their property and goods,
and they at the same time robbed our houses.&rsquo; I pitied him, and
asked, where are these two now? He answered, &lsquo;They are sitting
without the city, stark naked and utterly distressed.&rsquo; I
instantly took two suits of clothes with me and went [to them], and
having clothed them, brought them to my house. The people [of the
city], hearing [the circumstances of the robbery], continued coming to
see them, but they did not go out through shame. Three months passed in
this same manner; at last I reflected within myself, &lsquo;how long
will they thus remain squatted in a corner? If it can be brought about,
I will take them with me on some voyage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I proposed it to my brothers, and added, &lsquo;if you
please, I will go with you.<span class="corr" id="xd26e5735" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> They were silent. I again made the
necessary preparations for the voyage, purchased some goods for the
trade, and set out and took them with me. After I had distributed the
customary alms [for a prosperous voyage], and loaded the merchandise on
the ship, we weighed anchor, and the vessel set sail. This dog was
sleeping on the banks [of the river]; when he awoke, and saw the ship
in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5738" href="#xd26e5738" name=
"xd26e5738">189</a>]</span>the middle of the stream, he was surprised,
and having barked and jumped into the river, he began to swim [after
us]. I sent a skiff for him, at last having seized [the faithful
animal], they conveyed him into the ship. One month passed in safety on
the river; somehow, my second brother became enamoured of my slave
girl. One day, he thus spoke to our eldest brother, that, &lsquo;to
bear the load of our younger brother&rsquo;s favours is very shameful;
what remedy shall we apply to this [evil]?&rsquo; The eldest answered,
&lsquo;I have formed a plan in my mind; if it can be executed, it will
be a great thing.&rsquo; Both at last consulted together, and settled
it between them to destroy me, and seize all my property and goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day, I was asleep in the cabin, and the female slave was
<i>shampooing</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5744src" href="#xd26e5744"
name="xd26e5744src">39</a> me, when my second brother came in hastily
and awaked me. I started up in a hurry, and came forth [on deck]. This
dog also followed me. I saw my eldest brother leaning on his hands
against the vessel&rsquo;s side, and intensely looking at the wonders
of the river, and calling out to me. I went up to him and said,
&lsquo;is all well?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;Behold this strange
sight; mermen are dancing in the stream, with pearl, oysters, and
branches of coral in their hands.&rsquo; If any other had related this
circumstance so contrary to reason, I should not, indeed, have believed
it. I imagined what my brother said to be true, and bent down my head
to look at it. How <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5753" href=
"#xd26e5753" name="xd26e5753">190</a>]</span>much soever I looked, I
perceived nothing, and he kept saying, &lsquo;Do you now see it?&rsquo;
Now, had there been anything, I should have seen it. Perceiving me [by
this trick] off my guard, my second brother came behind me,
unperceived, and gave me such a push that, without choice, I tumbled
into the water, and they began to scream and cry aloud, &lsquo;Run,
run, our brother has fallen into the river.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime the ship went on, and the waves carried me
away from it; I was plunging in the water, and drifting amidst the
waves. I became at last quite exhausted; I invoked the aid of God, but
nought was of any avail. All of a sudden my hand touched something; I
looked at it, and saw this dog. Perhaps, when they pushed me into the
river, he also jumped after me, and kept swimming close by my side. I
took hold of his tail, and God made him the cause of my salvation.
Seven days and nights passed in this manner; the eighth day we reached
the shore. I had no strength whatever left, but throwing myself on my
back, I rolled along as well as I could, and threw myself on the land.
I remained senseless for one whole day; the second day the dog&rsquo;s
barking reached my ears; I came to myself, and I thanked God [for my
salvation], I began looking around me, and perceived at a distance the
environs of a city; but where had I strength, that I should attempt to
reach it? Having no other resource, I continued crawling along about
two paces, and then rested; in this way I had finished a
<i>kos</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e5759src" href="#xd26e5759" name=
"xd26e5759src">40</a> of the road by the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half way [to the city] I reached a mountain, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5767" href="#xd26e5767" name=
"xd26e5767">191</a>]</span>lay there all night; the next morning I
reached the city; when I came to the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> and saw the
shops of the bakers and confectioners, my heart began to palpitate, for
I had not money to buy, nor did I feel inclined to beg. In this way, I
went along, saying to myself, I will ask something in the next shop. At
last, strength had failed me, and my stomach<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5772src" href="#xd26e5772" name="xd26e5772src">41</a> yearned
with extreme hunger; life was nearly quitting my body. By chance, I saw
two young men dressed like Persians, walking along hand in hand. On
seeing them, my spirits revived, as they seemed [by their dress] to be
my countrymen&mdash;perhaps some of my acquaintance&mdash;to whom,
therefore, I might relate my circumstances. When they drew near, [I
perceived] they were of a verity, my brothers; and on perceiving this,
I was extremely rejoiced, and praised God, saying, &lsquo;God has
preserved my reputation; and I have not stretched forth my hands to
strangers [for subsistence].&rsquo; I went up to them and saluted them,
and kissed my eldest brother&rsquo;s hand. Immediately on seeing me,
they made a great noise, and my second brother struck me so forcibly
that I staggered and fell down. I seized my eldest brother&rsquo;s
robe, thinking that he would perhaps take my part; but he gave me a
violent kick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, they both thoroughly pounded me, and behaved to me
as Joseph&rsquo;s brothers [did to him]. Though I besought them in
God&rsquo;s name [to desist] and implored mercy, yet they felt no pity.
A crowd assembled [round us]; and every one asked, &lsquo;What is this
man&rsquo;s crime?&rsquo; Then my brothers replied, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5777" href="#xd26e5777" name=
"xd26e5777">192</a>]</span>&lsquo;This rascal was our brother&rsquo;s
servant and pushed him over into the sea, and seized all his treasure
and property. We have been long in search of him, and to-day he has
appeared [to us] in this guise.&rsquo; They then continued questioning
me, saying, &lsquo;O villain! what [infernal idea] entered thy mind,
that thou murderedst our brother? What injury had he done to thee? Had
he behaved ill to thee, that he had made thee superintendent [of his
affairs]?&rsquo; They both then tore their own clothes, and wept loudly
with sham grief for their brother, and continued to beat and kick
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, the soldiers of the governor arrived, and
having spoken to them threateningly, said, &lsquo;Why do you beat
him?&rsquo; And taking hold of my hand, they carried me to the
magistrate. These two<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5782src" href=
"#xd26e5782" name="xd26e5782src">42</a> also went with us, and repeated
to the magistrate the same [tale which they had told the crowd], and
having given him something by way of bribe, they demanded justice, and
insisted on blood for blood. The magistrate asked me [what I had to say
for myself]. Such was my condition from hunger and the blows [I had
received], that I had not strength to speak; hanging down my head, I
remained standing [in silence]; no answer issued from my mouth. The
magistrate also became convinced that I was assuredly a murderer; he
ordered me to be led to the plain, and placed on the stake.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5785src" href="#xd26e5785" name=
"xd26e5785src">43</a> O, protector of the world,<a class="noteref" id=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5800" href="#xd26e5800" name=

released from the Jew&rsquo;s bondage; in return for which, they having
given money, endeavoured to take away my life. They are both present;
ask them if [in all I have related] I have varied a hair&rsquo;s
breadth [from the truth]<span class="corr" id="xd26e5802" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> Well, they led me out [to the plain]; when I saw
the stake, I washed my hands of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except this dog, I had no one else to weep for me; his state
was such that he rolled on every one&rsquo;s feet and barked. Some beat
him with sticks, and others with stones, but he would not stir from
that place. I stood with my face towards the
<i>&#7731;&#299;bla</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5810src" href=
"#xd26e5810" name="xd26e5810src">45</a> and addressing myself to God, I
said, &lsquo;At this moment I have no one except Thee to intervene and
save the innocent! Now, if Thou savest, I am saved.&rsquo; After this
address, I repeated the prayer of <i>shah&#257;dat</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5825src" href="#xd26e5825" name=
"xd26e5825src">46</a> staggered, and then fell. By the dispensation of
God, it so happened, that the king of that country was attacked with
the cholic; the nobles and physicians assembled; whatever remedies they
applied, produced no good. One holy man said, &lsquo;The best of all
remedies is, that alms be given to the destitute, and that all
prisoners should be released; for in prayer there is greater efficacy
than in physic.&rsquo; Instantly the royal messengers went off running
towards the prisons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By chance, some one came to that plain [where I was], and
seeing a crowd, he ascertained [from a bystander] <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5833" href="#xd26e5833" name=
"xd26e5833">194</a>]</span>that they were placing some person on the
stake. Immediately on hearing this, he galloped up to the stake, and
cut the ropes with his sword. He threatened and chastised the
magistrate&rsquo;s soldiers, and said, &ldquo;At such a time, when the
king is in such a state, are you going to put a creature of God to
death?&rsquo; and he got me released. Upon which, these two brothers
went again to the magistrate, and urged him to put me to death. As this
official had already taken a bribe from them, he [readily] acquiesced
to do whatever they dictated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magistrate said to them, &lsquo;Rest satisfied; I will
now confine him in such a way, that he will of himself, from want of
food and drink, die of sheer exhaustion, and no one will know anything
about it.&rsquo; They re-seized me, and kept me In a corner. About a
<i>kos</i> without the city was a mountain, in which, in the time of
Solomon, the <i>d&#299;vs</i> had dug a deep and narrow well; it was
called Solomon&rsquo;s prison. Whoever fell greatly under the
king&rsquo;s wrath, was confined in that well, where he perished of
himself [from hunger and thirst<span class="corr" id="xd26e5843" title=
"Not in source">]</span>. To shorten my story, these two brothers and
the magistrate&rsquo;s soldiers carried me at night, in silence, to the
mountain, and having cast me into that pit, and thus set their own
minds at ease, they returned. O king, this dog went with me, and when
they put me into the well, he remained lying on its brink. I lay some
time senseless in the inside, and then a little consciousness returned
to me; I conceived myself to be dead, and that place my grave At this
time I heard the sounds of two men&rsquo;s voices, who were saying
something to each other; I concluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5846" href="#xd26e5846" name="xd26e5846">195</a>]</span>that
these were <i>Nak&#299;r</i> and <i>Munkir</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5855src" href="#xd26e5855" name="xd26e5855src">47</a> who were
come to question me; and I likewise heard the rustling of a rope, as if
some one had let it down there. I was wondering, and began to feel
about me on the ground, when some bones came into my gripe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a moment, a noise like that made by the mouth when some
one is masticating, struck my ears. I exclaimed, &lsquo;O creatures of
God, who are ye; tell me for God&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo; They laughed, and
said, &lsquo;This is the great Solomon&rsquo;s prison, and we are
prisoners.&rsquo; I asked them, &lsquo;Am I really alive?&rsquo; They
again laughed heartily, and replied, &lsquo;You are as yet alive, but
will soon die.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You are eating; what would it be
if you were to give me some?&rsquo; They then got angry, and gave me a
dry answer, but nothing else. After eating and drinking, they fell
asleep. I through faintness and weakness, fell into a swoon, and wept
and dreamed of God. Mighty sire, I had been seven days in the sea, and
so many days since without food, owing to my brothers&rsquo; false
accusation; yea, instead of food, I had got a beating, and was now
ingulfed in such a prison, that not the least appearance of release
came even into my imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, life was leaving me; sometimes it came, and
sometimes it left me. From time to time some person used to come at
midnight, and let down by a rope some bread tied up in a handkerchief,
and a jar of water, and used to call out. Those two men <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5871" href="#xd26e5871" name=
"xd26e5871">196</a>]</span>who were confined near me used to seize it
and eat and drink. The dog constantly witnessing this circumstance,
exerted his intelligence, thus, &lsquo;In the way in which this person
lets down water and bread into the pit, do thou also make some
contrivance whereby some food may reach this destitute one, who is thy
master, then may his life be saved.<span class="corr" id="xd26e5873"
title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> Thus having reflected, he went
to the city, [and saw that] round cakes of bread piled up on the
counter at a baker&rsquo;s shop; leaping up, he seized a cake in his
mouth, and ran off with it; the people pursued him, and pelted him with
clods, but he would not quit the cake; they became tired [of pursuing
him], and returned; the dogs of the city ran after him; he fought arid
struggled with them, and having saved the cake, he came to the well,
and threw in the bread. There was sufficient light for me to see the
cake lying near me, and I heard, moreover, the dog bark. I took up the
cake; and the dog, after throwing down the bread, went to look for
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the outskirts of a certain village, there was an old
woman&rsquo;s hut; jars and pots filled with water stood [at the door],
and the old woman was spinning. The dog went up to the pot, and
attempted to seize it; the old woman made a threatening noise, and the
pot slipped from the dog&rsquo;s mouth and fell upon an earthenware jar
which was broken; the rest of the vessels were upset and the water
spilt. The old woman seized a stick, and rose up to beat [the animal];
the dog seized the skirt of her clothes, and began to rub his mouth on
her feet, and wag his tail; then he ran towards the mountain; again
having returned to her, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5878" href=
"#xd26e5878" name="xd26e5878">197</a>]</span>he sometimes seized a
rope, and sometimes having taken up a bucket in his mouth, he shewed it
[to her<span class="corr" id="xd26e5880" title=
"Not in source">]</span>; and he rubbed his face against her feet, and
seizing the hem of her garment, he continued pulling her. The Almighty
inspired the old woman&rsquo;s heart with compassion, so that she took
up the rope and bucket and went along with him. He keeping hold of the
end of her clothes, after coming out of the hut, kept going on before
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, he guided her to the very mountain; the old woman
imagined, from the dog&rsquo;s conduct, that his master was confined in
the well, and that he, perhaps, wanted water for him. In short,
conducting the old woman, he came to the mouth of the well. The old
woman filled the bucket with water and let it down by a rope. I seized
the vessel and ate a morsel of the cake. I drank two or three gulps of
the water, and satisfied my hunger and thirst.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5885src" href="#xd26e5885" name="xd26e5885src">48</a> I thanked
God [for this timely supply], and retired to a corner, and waited with
patience for the interference of the Almighty, saying, &ldquo;Now let
us see what is to come about.&rdquo; In this manner, this dumb animal
used to bring me bread, and by means of the old woman, he used to
supply me with water to drink. When the bakers perceived that the dog
always carried off bread [in this way], they took compassion on him,
and made it a rule to throw him a cake whenever they saw him; and if
the old woman neglected to carry the water, he used to break her pots;
so that she, being helpless, used to let down a bucket of water every
day. This faithful companion removed all my apprehensions for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5888" href="#xd26e5888" name=
"xd26e5888">198</a>]</span>bread and water, and he himself always lay
at the mouth of the prison. Six months passed in this manner; but what
must be the condition of the man who was confined so long in such a
prison, where the air of heaven could never reach him? Only my skin and
bones remained; life became a torment to me, and I used to say in my
heart, &lsquo;O God, it would be better if my life became
extinct!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night, the two prisoners were asleep; my heart overflowed
[with sorrow], and I began to weep bitterly, and supplicate<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5892src" href="#xd26e5892" name=
"xd26e5892src">49</a> the Almighty [to end my woes]. At the last
quarter [of the night], what do I see! that, by the dispensation of
God, a rope was hanging down in the well, and I heard [some one] in a
low voice saying, &lsquo;O, unfortunate wretch! tie the end of the rope
tightly to thy hands, and escape from this place.&rsquo; On hearing
these words, I in my heart imagined that my brothers had at last felt
compassion for me, and, from the ties of blood, had come in person to
take me out. With much joy I tied the rope tightly to my waist; some
one pulled me up. The night was so dark, that I could not recognise the
person who had hauled me up. When I was out, he said, &lsquo;Come, be
quick; this is no place to tarry.&rsquo; I had no strength whatever
left; but from fear I rolled down the hill as well as I could. Then I
saw at the bottom two horses standing, ready saddled; that person
mounted me one of them, and he mounted the other himself, and took the
lead. Proceeding on, we reached the banks of a river. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5895" href="#xd26e5895" name=
"xd26e5895">199</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning appeared, and we had gone forth ten or twelve
<i>kos</i> from the city. I then saw the young man [very clearly]; he
was completely armed, having on a coat of mail, together with back,
front, and sidepieces [of burnished steel],<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5901src" href="#xd26e5901" name="xd26e5901src">50</a> and with
iron armour on his horse; he was looking at me with great rage, and
biting his lips, he drew his sword from the scabbard, and springing his
horse towards mine, he made a cut at me. I threw myself off my horse
[on the ground], and called out for mercy, and said, &lsquo;I am
faultless; why are you about to kill me? O, kind sir, from such a
prison you have taken me out, and now wherefore this unkindness?&rsquo;
He replied, &lsquo;Tell me the truth, who art thou.&rsquo; I answered,
I am a traveller, and have been involved in unmerited calamity; by your
humane assistance, I have at last come out alive. And I addressed to
him many other flattering expressions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God inspired his heart with pity. He sheathed his sword, and
said, &lsquo;Well, what God wills, he does; go, I spare thee thy life;
remount quickly; this is no place to delay.&rsquo; We put our horses to
their speed, and went forward; on the road he continued to sigh and
show signs of regret. By the time of mid-day,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5906src" href="#xd26e5906" name="xd26e5906src">51</a> we reached
an island. There the young man got off his horse, and made me also
dismount; he took off the saddles and pads from the horses&rsquo;
backs, and let them loose to graze; he also took off his arms from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5912" href="#xd26e5912" name=
"xd26e5912">200</a>]</span>his own person, and sat clown and said to
me, &lsquo;O you of evil destiny, relate now your story, that I may
know who you are,&rsquo; I told him my name and place of residence, and
whatever various misfortunes had befallen me, I related to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the young man had heard all my history, he wept, and
addressing himself to me, he said, &lsquo;O youth, hear now my story. I
am the daughter of the <i>r&#257;j&#257;</i> of the land of
<i>Zerb&#257;d</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5923src" href=
"#xd26e5923" name="xd26e5923src">52</a> and that young man who is
confined in the prison of Solomon, his name is <i>Bahramand</i>; he is
the son of my father&rsquo;s prime minister. One day the
<i>Mah&#257;r&#257;j</i> [my father] ordered that all the
<i>r&#257;j&#257;s</i> and <i>ku&#7749;wars</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5941src" href="#xd26e5941" name="xd26e5941src">53</a> should
assemble on the plain, which lay under the lattices [of the seraglio]
to shoot arrows, and play at <i>chaug&#257;n</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5955src" href="#xd26e5955" name="xd26e5955src">54</a> so that the
horsemanship and dexterity of every individual might be displayed. I
was seated near the <i>r&#257;n&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5963src" href="#xd26e5963" name="xd26e5963src">55</a> my mother,
behind one of the lattices of the highest story, and the female
servants and slaves were in waiting around; there I was looking at the
sport. The minister&rsquo;s son was the handsomest [man] among them;
and having caracoled his horse, he performed his exercises with much
address. He appeared very agreeable [in my eyes], and my heart became
enamoured of him. I kept this circumstance concealed for a long while.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5975" href="#xd26e5975" name=
"xd26e5975">201</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;At last, when I became quite restless, I
mentioned it to my hand-maid, and gave her many presents [to gain her
assistance]. She contrived, by some means or other, to introduce the
youth in secrecy into my apartment; he then began to love me likewise.
Many days passed in these love interviews. In short, the sentinels saw
him one midnight going armed into my apartment, and seized him, and
informed the <i>r&#257;j&#257;</i> of the circumstance. The
<i>r&#257;j&#257;</i> ordered him to be put to death; through the
solicitations of all the officers of state, his life was pardoned, but
he was ordered to be thrown into the prison of Solomon; and the other
young man, who is a fellow-prisoner with him, is his brother, and was
with him the night [he was seized]. Both were put into the well, and it
is now three years since they were confined, but no one has yet found
out why the youth entered the <i>r&#257;j&#257;&rsquo;s</i> palace. God
has preserved my character [from public exposure], and in return for
his goodness, I conceived it my duty to continue to supply the two
prisoners with bread and water. Since their confinement I go there
every eight days, and let them down eight days&rsquo; provisions at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Last night, I saw in a dream that somebody
advised me, saying, &ldquo;arise quickly and take a horse, a dress, a
rope-ladder, and some money for expenses, and go to that pit, and
deliver from thence the unfortunate prisoners.<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5989" title="Not in source">&rdquo;</span> On hearing this, I
started up [from my sleep], and being greatly rejoiced, I dressed
myself like a man, filled a casket with jewels and gold pieces, and
taking this horse and some clothes with me, I went to the prison to
draw them out with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5992" href=
"#xd26e5992" name="xd26e5992">202</a>]</span>rope-ladder. It was in
your fate to be delivered from such a confinement in this manner; no
one knows what I have done; perhaps he was some protecting angel who
sent me to enlarge you. Well, whatever was in my destiny, the same has
come to pass.&rsquo; After finishing this relation, she took out some
cakes fried in butter, some wheaten bread, some pulse, and meat curry
from her handkerchief; but first, she dissolved some sugar in a cup of
water, and put some spirit of <i>bed-mushk</i> in it, and gave it to
me. I took it from her hand and drank it, and then ate some breakfast.
After a short while, she made me wrap a piece of cloth round my waist,
and led me to the river, and with scissors she cut my hair and nails
and bathing me, dressed me in the clothes [she had brought], and made a
new man of me. I, having turned my face to the <i>&#7731;ibla</i>
offered up a prayer of thanksgiving; the beautiful girl regarded what I
was doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I had finished from praying, she asked me, &lsquo;What
hast thou been thus doing?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I have been
worshipping the Almighty God who has created the whole world, and who
has effected my relief through a being lovely as thou art, and who has
inclined thy heart to kindness towards me, and caused me to be released
from such a prison. His person is without an equal,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6002src" href="#xd26e6002" name="xd26e6002src">56</a> to Him I
have performed my devotions, and obeisance, and rendered my
thanks.&rsquo; On hearing these words she said, &lsquo;You are a
<i>Musalm&#257;n</i>.&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;Thanks be to God, I
am,&rsquo; &lsquo;My heart,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;is delighted with
your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6011" href="#xd26e6011" name=
"xd26e6011">203</a>]</span>pious expressions; instruct me also, and
teach me to recite your <i>kalima</i>.&rsquo; I said in my own heart,
&lsquo;God be praised that she is inclined to embrace our faith.&rsquo;
In short, I recited [our creed], viz., &lsquo;There is no God but God,
and <i>Muh&#803;ammad</i> is the apostle of God,&rsquo; and made her
repeat it. Then mounting our horses, we two set out from thence. When
we halted at night, she talked of [nothing else but] our religion and
faith; and she listened and felt delighted [with my words]. In this way
we journeyed on incessantly day and night, for two months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, we arrived in a country which lay between the
boundaries of the kingdoms of <i>Zerb&#257;d</i> and
<i>Sar&#257;nd&#299;p</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6027src" href=
"#xd26e6027" name="xd26e6027src">57</a> a city appeared, which was more
populous than Constantinople, and the climate very fine and agreeable.
On finding that the king of that country was more renowned for his
justice than <i>Naush&#299;rw&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6043src" href="#xd26e6043" name="xd26e6043src">58</a>, and also
for being the protector of his subjects; my heart was greatly rejoiced.
Having there bought a house, we took up our residence. After some days,
when we had got over the fatigues of the journey, I purchased some
necessary articles, and married the young lady according to the law of
<i>Muh&#803;ammad</i>, and lived with her. In the space of three years,
I having freely associated with the great and small of that place,
established my credit, and entered into an extensive trade. At last, I
surpassed all the merchants of that place. One day, I went for the
purpose of paying my respects <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6056"
href="#xd26e6056" name="xd26e6056">204</a>]</span>to the first
<i>waz&#299;r</i>, and saw a great crowd of people assembled on a
plain. I asked some one, &lsquo;Why is there such a crowd here?&rsquo;
I learnt that two persons had been caught in the act of adultery and
theft; and perhaps they had even committed murder; they were brought
here to be stoned [to death].</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing this [circumstance], I recollected my own case;
that once upon a time I had likewise been led in the same manner to be
empaled, and that God preserved me. &lsquo;Who can these be,&rsquo; [I
said to myself], &lsquo;that they should have become involved in such
calamity? I do not even know if they are justly [punished], or, like
me, the victims of a false accusation.&rsquo; Pressing through the
crowd, I reached [the spot where the culprits stood], and perceived
they were my brothers, who were led along with their hands tied behind
their backs, and with bare heads and feet. On seeing their sad state,
my blood boiled, and my liver was on fire. I gave the guards a handful
of gold pieces, and besought them to delay [the execution] for a
moment; and from thence, having put my horse to his utmost speed, I
went to the governor&rsquo;s house. I presented to him, as a
<i>naz&#817;ar</i>, a ruby of inestimable value, and made intercession
for them. He replied, &lsquo;A person has a plaint against them, and
their crimes have been fully proved; the king&rsquo;s mandate has been
issued, and I have no alternative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, after much entreaty and supplication [on my part],
the governor sent for the complainant, and made him consent that for
five thousand pieces of silver he should withdraw his charge of murder.
I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6068" href="#xd26e6068" name=
"xd26e6068">205</a>]</span>counted out the money, and got his written
engagement [not to prosecute them again], and had them released from
their dire calamity. O protector of the world! ask them if I tell truth
or falsehood.&rdquo; Here the two brothers stood in silence, and hung
down their heads like those who are ashamed. &ldquo;Well, [to proceed],
I got them released, and brought them to my house, had them bathed and
dressed, and gave them apartments for their residence in the
<i>d&#299;w&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na</i>. I did not at that time
introduce my wife to them; I myself attended to all their wants, and
ate [and drank] with them, and at the hour of sleep returned to my
apartment. For the space of three years [the time] thus passed in my
kind treatment of them, and on their part, no evil action took place,
so as to be the cause of my displeasure. When I used to go out riding
any where, they remained at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened, that my good wife went one day to the bath; when
she came to the <i>d&#299;w&#257;n-k&#863;h&#257;na,</i> seeing no male
person there, she took off her veil; perhaps my second brother was
lying down there awake, and immediately on seeing her, he became
enamoured of her. He imparted [the circumstance] to our eldest brother,
and they formed a plan together for murdering me. I had no knowledge
whatever of this circumstance; on the contrary, I used to say to
myself, &lsquo;God be praised, that this time, as yet, they have done
nothing such [as they formerly did]; their conduct is now correct;
perhaps they have felt the effects of shame.&rsquo; One day, after
dinner, my eldest brother began to weep, and to praise our native
country, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6078" href="#xd26e6078"
name="xd26e6078">206</a>]</span>to describe the delights of
<i>Ir&#257;n.</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6082src" href="#xd26e6082"
name="xd26e6082src">59</a> On hearing this, the other brother began to
sigh. I said, &lsquo;If you wish to return to our native land; then it
is well; I am devoted to your pleasure, and it is also my own wish.
Now, if it please God, I will go along with you.&rsquo; I mentioned the
circumstance of my brothers&rsquo; afflictions to my wife, and also my
own intentions. That sensible woman replied, &lsquo;You may think so;
but they again design to perpetrate some villany [towards you]; they
are the enemies of your life; you have fostered [a brace of] serpents
in your sleeve, and you still place reliance on their regard. Act as
you please, but beware of those who are noxious.&rsquo; At all events,
the preparations for the journey were completed in a short time, and
the tents pitched on the plain. A great <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i>
assembled, and they agreed to confer on me the rank of leader and
<i>&#7731;&#257;fila-b&#257;sh&#299;.</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6099src" href="#xd26e6099" name="xd26e6099src">60</a> A
propitious hour being ascertained, [the <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i>] set
out; but on my part, I was on my guard against my brothers, though in
every way I obeyed their commands, and made everything agreeable to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day [when we arrived] at our stage, my second brother
said that, &lsquo;one <i>farsak&#863;h</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6121src" href="#xd26e6121" name="xd26e6121src">61</a> from this
place is a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6136" href="#xd26e6136"
name="xd26e6136">207</a>]</span>running fountain like
<i>salsab&#299;l</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6140src" href=
"#xd26e6140" name="xd26e6140src">62</a> and in the [circumjacent]
plain, for miles around, lilies, and tulips, and narcissuses, and
roses, grow spontaneously. In truth, it is a delightful spot to walk
in; if we had our will, we would go there to-morrow, and enliven our
hearts [with the sight], and recover from our fatigues.&rsquo; I said,
&lsquo;you are masters here; if you command it, we will halt to-morrow,
and having gone to that spot, we will stroll about [and amuse
ourselves].&rsquo; They replied, &lsquo;what can we do better?&rsquo; I
gave orders, saying, &lsquo;advertise the whole <i>k&#257;fila</i> that
to-morrow there will be a halt,&rsquo; and I told my cook to prepare
breakfast, of every variety [of dishes] for next day, as we should go
on an excursion [of pleasure]. When the morning came, these two
brothers put on their clothes, and having armed themselves, they
reminded me to make haste, that we might arrive there in the cool [of
the morning] and enjoy our walk. I ordered my horse, but they observed
thus, &lsquo;The pleasure which results by viewing [the place] on foot,
can the same be felt in riding?<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6152src"
href="#xd26e6152" name="xd26e6152src">63</a> Give orders to the grooms
that they may lead the horses after us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two slaves carried the <i>kaliy&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6162src" href="#xd26e6162" name="xd26e6162src">64</a> and
coffee-pot, and went along with us. On the road, as we proceeded, we
amused ourselves by shooting arrows, and when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6174" href="#xd26e6174" name=
"xd26e6174">208</a>]</span>we had gone some distance from the
<i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i>, they sent one of the slaves on some errand.
Advancing a little farther, they sent the other slave also to call back
[the former]. My unfortunate fate would have it [that I remained
silent] as if some one had put a seal on my lips, and they did what
they wished, and having occupied my attention in talk, they continued
to lead me on; this dog, however, remained with me. When we had
advanced a considerable distance, I saw neither fountains nor gardens,
but a plain covered with thorns. There I had a call for making water,
and sat me down to perform it. I saw behind me a flash like that of a
sword; and, on looking back, my second brother struck me such a
sword-cut, that my skull was cleft in twain.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6179src" href="#xd26e6179" name="xd26e6179src">65</a> Before I
could call out, O savage! why dost thou murder me; my eldest brother
gave me [a blow] on the shoulder. Both wounds were severe, and I
staggered and fell; then these two pitiless ones mutilated me at their
ease, and left me weltering in my blood. This dog, on seeing my
condition, flew at them, and they wounded him likewise. After this,
they gave themselves some slight wounds, and ran back to the encampment
with naked feet and heads, and gave out, that &lsquo;some robbers have
murdered our brother on that plain, and we ourselves also in a close
encounter with them, have been wounded. Move off quickly, or else they
will immediately fall on the caravan, and utterly plunder us
all.&rsquo; When the people of the <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i> heard the
name of robbers, they immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6186" href="#xd26e6186" name="xd26e6186">209</a>]</span>became
alarmed, and marched off and made their escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife had [already] heard of the [former] conduct and
precious qualities of these [brothers of mine,] and of all the
treachery they had practised towards me; hearing now from these liars
the events [that had occurred], she instantly stabbed herself to death
with her dagger, and restored her soul to her Maker.&rdquo; O
<i>darweshes!</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6192src" href="#xd26e6192"
name="xd26e6192src">66</a> when the dog-worshipping
<i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> had thus far told us of the adventures
and misfortunes, I wept involuntarily on hearing them. The merchant
having perceived [my grief,] said, &ldquo;Lord of the world! if it were
not a want of respect, I would strip myself naked, and show the whole
of my body.&rdquo; Even on this, to [prove] the truth [of what he had
related,] he tore his dress off his shoulders, and showed to us [his
person]. In truth, there was not the space of four fingers on it free
from wounds; and he took off his turban before me from his head, and
there was such a great dint in his skull, that a whole pomegranate
might be put into it. All the officers of state who were present shut
their eyes, they had not the power of beholding [the shocking
sight].</p>
<p>The <i>k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;ja</i> then continued his narrative,
saying, &ldquo;O blessed majesty! when these brothers, as they thought,
had finished their work and went away; on the one side, I lay wounded,
and on the other side, this dog lay wounded near me. I lost so much
blood from my body, that I had not the least strength or sensation
left, and I cannot conceive how life remained. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6210" href="#xd26e6210" name=
"xd26e6210">210</a>]</span>The spot where I lay was on the boundary of
the kingdom of <i>Sar&#257;nd&#299;p</i>, and a very populous city was
situated near the place; in that city there was a great pagoda, and the
king of that country had a daughter extremely well-favoured and
beautiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many kings and princes were desperately in love with her.
There, the custom of [wearing] the veil was unknown; for which reason
the princess used to roam about, hunting all day with her companions.
Near [the spot where I lay] was a royal garden; she had on that day got
leave from her father, and had come to that same garden. Walking about
by way of recreation, she chanced to pass over that plain; some female
attendants also accompanied her on horseback. They came to the spot
where I lay, hearing my groans, they stopped near me. Seeing me in this
condition, they rode off to the princess, and said, that &lsquo;a
miserable man and a dog are lying weltering in their blood.&rsquo; On
hearing this from them, the princess herself came near me, and,
afflicted [at the sight,] she said, &lsquo;See if any life still
remains.&rsquo; Two or three of the attendants dismounted and having
examined me, replied, &lsquo;He still breathes.&rsquo; The princess
instantly ordered them to lay me carefully on a carpet and carry me to
the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they brought me there, [the princess] having sent for
the royal surgeon, gave him many injunctions respecting the cure both
of myself and of my dog, and gave him hopes of a reward and a gratuity.
The surgeon having thoroughly wiped my whole body, cleaned it from dust
and blood, and having washed the wounds with spirits, he stitched them
and put on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6219" href="#xd26e6219"
name="xd26e6219">211</a>]</span>plasters; and he ordered the extract of
the musk-willow<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6221src" href="#xd26e6221"
name="xd26e6221src">67</a> to be dropped down my throat in lieu of
water. The princess herself used to sit at the head [of my bed], and
see that I was attended to; and two or four times during the day and
night she made me swallow, from her own hands, some broth or
<i>sharbat</i>. At last, when I came to myself, I heard the princess
say with sorrow, &lsquo;What bloody tyrant hath used thee so cruelly?
did he not fear even the great idol?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6230src" href="#xd26e6230" name="xd26e6230src">68</a> After ten
days, with the efficacy of the spirit of <i>bed-mushk</i>, and
<i>sharbats</i>, and electuaries, I opened my eyes; and saw as if the
whole court of <i>Indra</i> were standing around me, and the princess
at the head of my bed. I heaved a sigh and wished to move myself, but
had not sufficient strength. The princess said with kindness, &lsquo;O
Persian, be of good cheer, and do not grieve; though some cruel
oppressor hath used thee thus; yet the great idol has made me
favourable towards thee, and thou wilt now recover.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear by that God who is one, and without a partner, that
on beholding her I again became senseless; the princess also perceived
it, and sprinkled me with rose water out of a phial held by her own
fair hand. In twenty days my wounds filled up and granulated; the
princess used to come [regularly] at night when all were asleep, and
she then supplied me with food and drink. In short, after forty days, I
performed the ablution [of perfect recovery];<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6245src" href="#xd26e6245" name="xd26e6245src">69</a> the
princess was extremely rejoiced, and rewarded the surgeon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6251" href="#xd26e6251" name=
"xd26e6251">212</a>]</span>largely, and clothed me richly. By the grace
of God, and the care and attentions of the princess, I became quite
stout and healthy, and my constitution became sound; the dog also grew
fat. She made me drink wine every day, listened to my conversation, and
was pleased. I used also to amuse her by relating some agreeable
stories and brief narratives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day she asked to me, &lsquo;pray relate thy adventures,
and tell me who you are, and how this accident has happened to
you,&rsquo; I related to her my whole history from beginning to end. On
hearing this, she wept and said, &lsquo;I will now behave to thee in
such a manner that thou wilt forget all thy [past] misfortunes,&rsquo;
I replied, &lsquo;God preserve you; you have bestowed on me a second
existence, and I am now wholly yours; for God&rsquo;s sake, be pleased
ever to regard me in this favourable manner.&rsquo; In short, she used
to sit all night with me alone; sometimes the nurse likewise stayed
with her and heard my stories, and related [others herself.] When the
princess used to go away and I remained alone, I used to perform my
ablutions, and concealing myself in a corner, I used to say my
prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once it so happened, that the princess had gone to her
father, and I was repeating my prayers in perfect security, after
having performed my ablutions, when suddenly the princess, conversing
with her nurse, entered, saying, &lsquo;Let us see what the Persian is
now doing; whether he be asleep or awake!&rsquo; But seeing that I was
not in my place, she was greatly surprised, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Hey
day! where is he gone? I hope he has not formed an attachment with some
one else.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6257" href=
"#xd26e6257" name="xd26e6257">213</a>]</span>She began to examine every
hole and corner in search of me, and at last came to where I was saying
my prayers. She had never seen any one perform his prayers;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6259src" href="#xd26e6259" name=
"xd26e6259src">70</a> she stood in silence, and looked on. When I had
finished my prayers, and lifted up my arms to bless God, and prostrated
myself, she laughed loudly, and said, &lsquo;What! is this man become
mad? what various postures does he assume?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing the sound of her laughter, I became alarmed. The
princess advanced, and asked me, &lsquo;O Persian, what wast thou
doing?&rsquo; I could make no reply, on which the nurse said,
&lsquo;May I take [the responsibility of] thy evils, and become thy
sacrifice, it appears to me that this man is a <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>,
and the enemy of <i>L&#257;t</i> and <i>Man&#257;t</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6276src" href="#xd26e6276" name=
"xd26e6276src">71</a> he worships an unseen God. The princess
immediately on hearing this struck her hands together, and said in
great wrath, &lsquo;I did not know he was a Turk,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6287src" href="#xd26e6287" name="xd26e6287src">72</a> and an
unbeliever in our gods, for which reason he had fallen under the wrath
of our idol. I have erroneously saved him and kept him in my
house,&rsquo; Saying this she went away. On hearing [her words] I
became disturbed, [and alarmed to know] how she would now behave to me.
Through fear, sleep was driven from me, and until morning I continued
to weep, and to bathe my face with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed three days and nights, weeping in this fear and
hope. I never shut an eye [during this time.] <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6298" href="#xd26e6298" name=
"xd26e6298">214</a>]</span>The third night, the princess came to my
apartment flushed with the intoxication of wine, and the nurse along
with her. She was full of anger; and with a bow and arrows in her hand,
she sat down outside of the room, on the border of the
<i>chaman</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6303src" href="#xd26e6303"
name="xd26e6303src">73</a> she asked the nurse for a cup of wine, and
after drinking it off, she said, &lsquo;O nurse! is that Persian who is
involved in our great idol&rsquo;s wrath, dead, or does he yet
live?&rsquo; The nurse answered, &lsquo;May I bear your evils! some
life still remains,&rsquo; The princess said, &lsquo;He has now fallen
in my estimation; but tell him to come out.&rsquo; The nurse called me;
I ran forth and perceived that the princess&rsquo;s face glowed through
anger, and had become quite red. My soul remained not in my body; I
saluted her, and having joined both my hands together, stood before her
[in silent respect.] Giving me a look of anger, she said to the nurse,
&lsquo;If I kill this enemy of our faith with an arrow, will the great
idol pardon my guilt or not? I have already committed a great crime by
having kept him in my house, and by supplying [his wants.]&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nurse answered, &lsquo;What is the princess&rsquo;s
guilt? you did not in the least know him to be an enemy when you kept
him [in your house;] you took compassion upon him, and you will receive
good for the good you have done; and this man will receive from the
great idol the reward of the evil which he has done.&rsquo; On hearing
these words, the princess said, &lsquo;Nurse, tell him to sit
down.&rsquo; The nurse made me a sign to sit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6317" href="#xd26e6317" name=
"xd26e6317">215</a>]</span>down; I accordingly sat down. The princess
drank another cup of wine, and said to the nurse, &lsquo;Give this
wretch also a cup, then he will take his killing with more ease.&rsquo;
The nurse presented me a cup of wine; I drank it without hesitation,
and made my <i>sal&#257;m</i> [to the princess;] she never looked at me
directly, but continued all along to give me furtive side glances. When
I became elevated [with the effects of the wine,] I began to repeat
some pieces of poetry; among others, I recited the following
couplet:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;I am in thy power, and if alive yet, what
then?</p>
<p class="line">Under the dagger, if one breathes awhile, what
then?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">On hearing this verse, she smiled, and turning towards
the nurse, she said, &lsquo;What art thou sleepy?&rsquo; The nurse,
guessing her motive, replied, &lsquo;Yes, sleep over-comes me.&rsquo;
She then took her leave, and went away.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6329src" href="#xd26e6329" name="xd26e6329src">74</a> After a
short pause, the princess asked me for a cup of wine; I quickly filled
it, and presented it to her; she took it gracefully from my hand and
drank it off; I then fell at her feet; she passed her hand kindly over
me, and said, &lsquo;O ignorant man! what hast thou seen bad in our
great idol that thou hast betaken thyself to the worship of an unseen
God?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;Pray, be just, and reflect a little,
whether that God [and He only,] is worthy of adoration, who, out of a
drop of water, hath created a lovely creature like thee, and hath given
such beauty and perfection, that in one instant thou canst drive into
distraction the hearts of thousands of men. What a [contemptible] thing
is an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6332" href="#xd26e6332" name=
"xd26e6332">216</a>]</span>idol that any one should worship it? The
stone-cutters have shaped a block of stone into a figure, and have
spread it as a net to entangle fools. Those whom the devil beguiles,
confound the Creator with the created; and they prostrate themselves
before that which their own hands have formed. We are
<i>Musalm&#257;ns</i>, and we worship him who hath created us. For
those [misguided idolaters], He hath created hell; for us [true
believers], He hath destined paradise; if you will place your faith in
God, you will experience the delights [of heaven], and distinguish
truth from error, and you will find that your [present] devotion is
false.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, on hearing these pious admonitions, the heart of
that stony-hearted one became softened, and through the favour and
mercy of God she began to weep, and said, &lsquo;Well, teach me thy
faith,&rsquo; I taught her the <i>kalima</i>, which she repeated with
sincerity of heart, and having expressed penitence, and prayed for
pardon, she became a [true] <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>. I then threw myself
at her feet [and thanked her]. Until the morning she continued reciting
the <i>kalima</i>, and praying for pardon. Again she said, &lsquo;Well,
I have embraced your faith, but my parents are idolators; what remedy
is there for them?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;what is that to thee? as
any one acts, so will he be treated.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;They have
betrothed me to my uncle&rsquo;s son, and he is an idolator; if I
should be married to him tomorrow, which God forbid, he, an idolator,
would cohabit with me, and I should bear issue, which would be a
dreadful misfortune. We ought immediately to think of some remedy for
this, so that I may be freed from such a calamity,&rsquo; I replied,
&lsquo;what you say is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6349" href=
"#xd26e6349" name="xd26e6349">217</a>]</span>indeed reasonable; do
whatever you think proper.&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;I will remain here
no longer, but go forth somewhere else.&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;by what
means can you escape, and where will you go?&rsquo; She answered,
&lsquo;In the first place, do you leave me here, and go and abide with
the <i>Musalm&#257;ns</i> in the <i>sar&#257;&#299;</i>, so that every
one may hear of it, and not suspect you. You will there continue on the
look out for [the departure of] vessels, and if any vessel sails for
Persia, let me know; for which reason I will send the nurse to you
frequently, and when you send me word [that all is ready,] I will come
to you, and having embarked in the vessel, I will effect my escape and
obtain my release from the hands of these ill-fated heathens,&rsquo; I
replied, &lsquo;I will devote myself as a sacrifice for your life and
safety, but what will you do with the nurse?&rsquo; She answered,
&lsquo;Her case can be easily settled; I will give her a cup of strong
poison.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6358src" href="#xd26e6358" name=
"xd26e6358src">75</a> The plan was fixed upon, and when the day
appeared, I went to the <i>sar&#257;&#299;</i>, and hired a private
apartment and went and resided therein. During this absence, I only
lived in the hopes of meeting again. Two months<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6373src" href="#xd26e6373" name="xd26e6373src">76</a> [after this
event,] when the merchants of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6391"
href="#xd26e6391" name="xd26e6391">218</a>]</span><i>R&#363;m</i>, of
Syria, and of <i>Isfah&#257;n</i> were assembled together, they formed
the project of returning by water, and began to embark their
merchandise on vessels. From residing together I had formed
acquaintances with most of them, and they said to me, &lsquo;Well, sir,
will you not also come [along with us]; how long will you stay in this
country of infidels?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;what have I wherewith I
can return to my country? I have as my property this only, a female
slave, a chest, and a dog; if you could give me a little room to stay
in and fix its price, I shall then be at ease in my mind, and embark
likewise.<span class="corr" id="xd26e6399" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The merchants allotted me a cabin, and I paid the money for
the hire of it. Having set my heart at ease, I went to the
nurse&rsquo;s house under some pretext, and said, &lsquo;O mother, I am
come to take leave of thee, and am now returning to my country; if I
could through your kindness see the princess for a moment, it would be
a great satisfaction to me.&rsquo; At last, the nurse complied [with my
request]. I said, &lsquo;I will return at night, and wait in such a
place;&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; Having settled
[this point], I returned to the <i>sar&#257;&#299;</i>, and carried my
chest and bedding on board the vessel and delivered them in charge to
the master, and added, &lsquo;I will bring my female slave on board
to-morrow morning.&rsquo; The master said, &lsquo;Come speedily, as we
shall weigh anchor to-morrow early,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;Very
well.&rsquo; When the night came, I went to the place I had fixed upon
with the nurse, and waited. After a watch of the night had passed, the
gate of the seraglio opened, and the princess came out dressed in
soiled and dirty clothes, with a casket of jewels in her hand;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6407" href="#xd26e6407" name=
"xd26e6407">219</a>]</span>she delivered the casket to me, and went
along with me. As soon as it was morning, we reached the seaside, and
embarking on a skiff we went on board the vessel; this faithful dog
also went with me. When it was broad daylight, we weighed anchor and
set sail. We were sailing along in perfect security, when the report of
a cannon was heard from one of the ports. All [on board] were surprised
and alarmed; the ship was anchored, and a consultation was held among
us [to know] if the governor of the port intended some foul play, and
what could be the cause of the firing of cannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened, that all the merchants had some handsome female
slaves [on board], and for fear lest the governor of the port might
seize them, they locked them up in chests. I did so likewise, and
having shut up my princess in my chest, I locked it. In the meanwhile,
the governor and his suite appeared on board a swift sailing vessel,
and constantly nearing us, he came and boarded our ship. Perhaps the
cause of his coming to us was this: that when the news of the
nurse&rsquo;s death and the princess&rsquo;s disappearance became known
to the king, in consequence of his being ashamed to mention the
[princess&rsquo;s] name, he sent orders to the governor of the port,
saying, &lsquo;I have heard that the Persian merchants have very
handsome slaves with them, and as I wish to buy some for the princess,
you will stop them, and send all the slaves that may be in the vessel
to the royal presence. On seeing them, I will pay the full value for
such as may be approved of, and the remainder shall be
returned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the king&rsquo;s orders, the governor of the
port came himself on board our vessel for this <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6413" href="#xd26e6413" name=
"xd26e6413">220</a>]</span>purpose. Near my cabin was [the berth of]
another person; he also had a handsome female slave locked up in his
chest. The governor sat down on that chest, and began to collect all
the female slaves [that could be found]; I praised God, and said,
&lsquo;Well, no mention has been made of the princess.&rsquo; In short,
the governor&rsquo;s people put into their own vessel all the female
slaves that were to be found; and the governor, laughing, asked the
owner of the chest on which he was sitting, &lsquo;Thou hadst also a
female slave?&rsquo; The blockhead was frightened, and answered,
&lsquo;I swear by your Honour&rsquo;s feet, I alone have not acted in
this manner; all of us from fear of you have concealed our [handsome]
female slaves in our chests.&rsquo; The governor, on hearing this
confession, began to search all the chests. He opened my chest also,
and having taken out the princess, he carried her away with the rest. I
fell into a strange state of despair, and said to myself, &lsquo;such a
[dreadful] circumstance has occurred that thy life is gone for nothing;
and now we must see how he will treat the princess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my anxiety for her, I forgot all fear for my own life; the
whole day and night I spent in prayers to God [for her safety]. When
the next early morn arrived, they brought back all the female slaves in
their own vessel. The merchants were well pleased, and each took back
his own. All returned, but the princess alone was not among them. I
asked, &lsquo;What is the reason that my slave is not come back [with
the rest]?&rsquo; They answered, &lsquo;We do not know; perhaps the
king may have chosen her.&rsquo; All the merchants began to console and
comfort me, and said, &lsquo;Well, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6417" href="#xd26e6417" name="xd26e6417">221</a>]</span>what has
happened is past; do not afflict yourself; we will all subscribe and
make up her price, and give it to you.&rsquo; My senses were utterly
confounded; I said, &lsquo;I will not now go to Persia.&rsquo; Then I
addressed myself saying to the boatmen, &lsquo;O friends, take me with
you, and land me on the shore.&rsquo; They agreed, and I left the
vessel and stepped into the boat; this dog likewise came along with
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I reached the port, I kept to myself only the casket of
jewels which the princess had brought with her; all my other property I
gave to the governor&rsquo;s servants. I wandered everywhere in the way
of search, that perhaps I might get some intelligence of the princess;
but I could find no trace of her, nor could I get the smallest hint
respecting that affair. One night I entered the king&rsquo;s seraglio
by a trick, and searched for her, but got no intelligence. For nearly
the space of a month I sifted every lane and house in the city; and
through sorrow I reduced myself almost to death&rsquo;s door, and began
to wander about like a lunatic. At last, I fancied that &lsquo;my
princess must, in all probability, be in the governor&rsquo;s house,
and nowhere else.&rsquo; I went round and inspected the
governor&rsquo;s house, to the intent that should I discover any
passage I might enter it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceived a sewer high enough to allow a man to go in and
out, but there was an iron grating at its mouth; I formed the
resolution to enter [the house] by the way of this sewer; I took off my
clothes, and descended into that filthy channel. After a thousand
toils, I broke the grating, and entered the
<i>chor-mah&#803;all</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6425src" href=
"#xd26e6425" name="xd26e6425src">77</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6431" href="#xd26e6431" name="xd26e6431">222</a>]</span> through
the sewer. Then, having put on the dress of a woman, I began to search
and examine all around me. From one of the apartments a sound reached
my ear, as if some one was praying fervently. Advancing towards the
place, I saw it was the princess, who was weeping bitterly and was
prostrating herself before her Maker, and praying to him thus,
&lsquo;For the sake of thy prophet and his pure offspring,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6433src" href="#xd26e6433" name=
"xd26e6433src">78</a> deliver me from this country of infidels; and
restore me once more in safety to the person who taught me the faith of
<i>Isl&#257;m</i>.&rsquo; On seeing her, I ran and threw myself at her
feet; the princess clasped me to her bosom, and upon us both a state of
insensibility fell. When our senses were restored, I asked her what had
happened to her; she answered, &lsquo;When the governor of the port
carried all the female slaves on shore, I was offering up this prayer
to God that my secret might not any how be known, and that I might not
be recognised, and that your life might not be endangered. He is so
great a concealer [of our shame], that no one knew I was the princess.
The governor was examining every one with a view to purchase [some for
himself]; when it came to my turn, he chose me, sent me secretly to his
house; the rest he forwarded to the king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;When my father did not see me among those
[slaves], he sent them all back. The whole of this artifice was had
recourse to on my account. He now gives out, that the princess is very
ill, and if I do not soon appear, then in a few days the news of my
death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6444" href="#xd26e6444" name=
"xd26e6444">223</a>]</span>will fly through the whole country; then the
king&rsquo;s shame will not be [divulged]. But I am now greatly
distressed, as the governor has other designs upon me, and always urges
me to cohabit with him; I do not agree [to his desires]. Inasmuch as he
[really] loves me, he has as yet waited for my acquiescence, and
therefore he remains silent and quiet. But I dread [to think] how long
matters can go on in this way; for which reason I have determined
within myself, that when he attempts anything further, I will put
myself to death. But now that I have met thee, another thought has
arisen in my mind; if God is willing, except this mode, I see no other
for escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied, &lsquo;Let me hear it; what sort of scheme is
it?&rsquo; She said, &lsquo;If you assist and exert yourself, it can be
accomplished.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I am ready to obey your commands;
if you order me, I will leap into the burning flames, and if I could
find a ladder, I would for your sake ascend to the sky; [in short], I
will perform whatever you command.&rsquo; The princess said, &lsquo;Go,
then, to the temple of the great idol; and in the place where [the
people take off<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6448src" href="#xd26e6448"
name="xd26e6448src">79</a> their shoes, there lies a piece of black
canvas. The custom of this country is, that whoever becomes poor and
destitute, he having wrapt himself up in that piece of canvas, sits
down in that spot. The people of this country who go there to worship,
give him something, each according to his means.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In three or four days, when he collects some
money, the head priests give him a <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> on the
part of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6456" href="#xd26e6456"
name="xd26e6456">224</a>]</span>great idol, and dismiss him; having
thus become rich, he goes away, and no one knows who he was. Go thou
also, and sit under that canvas, and hide well thy hands and face, and
speak to no one. After three days, when the priests and idolaters shall
have given thee a <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>, and [wish greatly to]
dismiss thee; do not thou on any account get up from thence. When they
entreat thee greatly, then tell them, &ldquo;I do not want money nor am
I avaricious of riches. I am an injured person, and am come to
complain; if the mother of the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> does me justice, it
is well; otherwise the great idol will do me justice; and this same
great idol will attend to my complaint against my oppressor.&rdquo; As
long as the mother of the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> does not come herself to
thee, let any one entreat thee ever so much, consent thou not. At last,
being compelled to it, she will come to thee herself; she is very old,
for she is two hundred and forty years of age, and six and thirty sons,
that have been born of her, are the chief priests of the temple; and
she is highly respected by the great idol. For this reason she
possesses such vast power that all the little and great of this country
deem her command [a matter of] felicity; whatever she orders, that they
perform with all their heart and soul. Lay hold of the skirt of her
garment, and say to her, &ldquo;O mother, if you do not exact justice
from the oppressor to this injured traveller, I will dash my head on
the ground before the great idol; he will at last pity me, and
intercede for me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;When, after this, she asks thee all the
particulars of thy complaint, tell her, &ldquo;I am an inhabitant of
Persia; I am come here from a great distance, both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6469" href="#xd26e6469" name=
"xd26e6469">225</a>]</span>to perform a pilgrimage to the great idol,
and in consequence of having heard of your justice. For some days I
lived here in peace; my wife also came with me; she is young, her form
and figure are excellent, and her features perfect. I do not know how
the governor of the port saw her, but he forcibly took her away from
me, and shut her up in his house. With us <i>Musalm&#257;ns</i> it is a
rule, that if a stranger sees one of our wives, or takes her away, it
is right that the stranger be put to death by whatever means it may be
accomplished, and the wife be taken back; and otherwise, we must
abandon food and drink; for whilst the stranger lives, that wife is
forbidden to the husband. Now, having no other resource, I am come
hither; let us see what justice you do to me.&rdquo;&#8202;&rsquo; When
the princess had fully instructed me in all these circumstances, I took
my leave, and came out by the same sewer, and once more replaced the
iron grating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the morning came, I went to the temple, and,
having covered myself with the black canvas, I sat down. In three
days&rsquo; time so many pieces of gold, and silver, and articles of
apparel were heaped up near me, that it appeared a regular store. On
the fourth day, the priests, performing their devotion, and singing and
playing, came to me with a <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>, and wished to
dismiss me. I would not agree to it, and called on the great idol for
protection, and said, &lsquo;I am not come to beg, but to get justice
from the great idol and the mother of the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i>; and
until I get justice I shall not stir from hence.&rsquo; On hearing this
[determination], they went to the presence of the old woman, and
related what I had said; after which a <i>Br&#257;hman</i> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6486" href="#xd26e6486" name=
"xd26e6486">226</a>]</span>came to me and said, &lsquo;Come, the mother
calls you.&rsquo; I instantly wrapped myself up in the black canvas
from head to foot, and went to the threshold [of her apartment]. I saw
that the great idol was placed on a jewelled throne in which were set
rubies, diamonds, pearls and coral; and a rich covering was spread on a
golden chair, on which was seated, with great pomp and dignity, an old
woman dressed in black, with cushions and pillows [around her], and
near her stood two boys, ten or twelve years old, one on her right and
one on her left. She called me before her; I advanced towards her with
profound respect, and kissed the foot of the throne, and then took hold
of the skirt [of her garments]. She asked me my story; I related it
exactly as the princess had instructed mo to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing it, she said, &lsquo;Do <i>Musalm&#257;ns</i> keep
their wives concealed?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;Yes, may it fare well
with your children; it is an ancient custom of ours.&rsquo; She said,
&lsquo;Thine is a good religion; I will instantly give orders that the
governor of the port, together with your wife, shall appear here, and I
shall punish that ass in such a manner that he will not act so another
time, and all shall prick up their ears and tremble.&rsquo; She asked
her attendants, &lsquo;Who is the governor of the port? How dares he
take away by force the wife of another man?&rsquo; They answered,
&lsquo;He is such a one.&rsquo; On hearing his name, she told the two
boys who were standing near her, &lsquo;Take this man along with you
instantly, and go to the king, and say, &ldquo;That the mother
declares, that this is the command of the great idol, that whereas the
governor of the port commits excessive violence on the people; for
instance, he has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6493" href=
"#xd26e6493" name="xd26e6493">227</a>]</span>carried off [by force]
this poor man&rsquo;s wife, and his guilt is proved to be great;
therefore let an inventory be quickly taken of the delinquent&rsquo;s
effects and property, and let them be delivered to this Turk, whom I
esteem, otherwise you will be destroyed to-night, and you will fall
under our wrath.&rsquo; The two boys rose up, came out of the place,
and mounted their horses; all the priests, blowing their shells, and
singing hymns, went in their retinue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, the great and little of that country having
conceived the dust of the spot where the feet of those boys trod as
holy, used to take it up and put it to their eyes. In this manner, they
went to the palace of the king. He heard of it, and came forth with
naked feet for the purpose of their reception, and having conducted
them with great respect, he placed them on the throne near himself, and
asked them, &lsquo;What has given me the honour of your visit
to-day?&rsquo; The two young <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> repeated on the part
what they had heard from the mother, and threatened him with the great
idol&rsquo;s anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing it the king said, &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; and
issued an order to his attendants, saying, &lsquo;Let some officers of
justice go, and let them immediately bring the governor of the port,
along with that woman into our presence, then shall I, having
investigated his crime, inflict upon him deserved punishment.&rsquo; On
hearing [this order], I was greatly alarmed in my own heart, [and said
to myself], &lsquo;This affair indeed is not quite so well; for if they
bring the princess with the governor of the port, the matter will be
discovered; what then will be my situation?&rsquo; Being extremely
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6502" href="#xd26e6502" name=
"xd26e6502">228</a>]</span>fear-stricken in my mind, I looked up to
God, but my countenance was overcast with anxiety, and my body began to
tremble. The boys seeing my colour change, perhaps observed that this
order was not <span class="corr" id="xd26e6504" title=
"Source: ageeable">agreeable</span> to my wish; they instantly rose
with vexation and anger, and said harshly to the king, &lsquo;O wretch,
art thou become mad, that thou steppest aside from the great
idol&rsquo;s obedience, and conceivest what we said to be untrue, that
thou wishest to send for them both and verify [the circumstance]? Now,
take care, thou hast fallen under the great idol&rsquo;s wrath; we have
delivered our orders, now do thou look [to it], or the great idol will
look [to thee].&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing these words, the king was so greatly alarmed,
that, joining both his hands together, he stood [before the boys] and
trembled from head to foot. Having made humble supplication, he
endeavoured to appease them; but they would not sit down, and they
remained standing. In the meantime, all the nobles who were present,
began with one voice to speak ill of the governor, saying, &lsquo;He is
indeed such a wicked man, and so tyrannical, and commits such offences,
that we cannot relate the same before the royal presence. Whatever the
mother of the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> has sent word of, is all true;
inasmuch as it is the great idol&rsquo;s decision; how can it be
false?&rsquo; When the king heard the very same story from all, he was
much ashamed and regretful of what he had said. He instantly gave me a
rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>; and having written an order with his
own hand, and sealed<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6515src" href=
"#xd26e6515" name="xd26e6515src">80</a> with his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6532" href="#xd26e6532" name=
"xd26e6532">229</a>]</span>sign manual, he consigned it to me; he also
wrote a note to the mother of the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i>, and having laid
trays of gold and jewels before the boys as presents, he dismissed
them. I returned to the temple highly pleased, and went to the old
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contents of the king&rsquo;s letter which had arrived
were as follows. After the usual compliments and tenders of service and
devotion, [the king] had written, &lsquo;That according to the orders
of your highness, the situation of governor of the fort has been
conferred upon this <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>, and a
<i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6544src" href=
"#xd26e6544" name="xd26e6544src">81</a> has been bestowed on him. He is
now at liberty to put the former governor to death; and all his effects
and money now belong to this <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>; he may do with him
what he pleases. I hope my fault will be forgiven.&rsquo; The mother of
the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> was pleased with the letter, and said,
&lsquo;Let the music strike up in the <i>naubat-k&#863;h&#257;na</i> of
the <i>pagoda</i>.&rsquo; Then she sent with me five hundred well-armed
soldiers, who were good marksmen<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6563src"
href="#xd26e6563" name="xd26e6563src">82</a> with the musket, to go
with me, and gave them orders to go to the port, seize its governor,
and deliver him up to this <i>Musalm&#257;n</i>, in order that he may
put him to death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6578" href=
"#xd26e6578" name="xd26e6578">230</a>]</span>with what torture he
pleases. Also let them take care that, except this honoured
[<i>Musalm&#257;n</i>], no one be permitted to enter the
[governor&rsquo;s] seraglio, and let them deliver over his money and
effects [untouched to the new governor]. When he sends them back with
his own accord, let them get a letter of approbation from him, and
return to me.&rsquo; She then gave me a complete dress from the
wardrobe of the great idol, and having caused me to mount, she
dismissed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I reached the port, one of my men proceeded before me,
and informed the governor [of my arrival]. He was sitting like one in
great perplexity, when I arrived my heart was already filled with rage;
on seeing the harbour-master, I drew my sword, and struck him such a
blow on the neck, that his head flew off like a stalk of Indian corn.
Then having ordered the agents, the treasurers, the superintendants and
other officials to be seized, I took full possession of the records;
and then I entered the seraglio. There I met the princess; we embraced
each other most tenderly, and wept, and praised the goodness of God; we
wiped each other&rsquo;s tears; I then came out and sat on the
<i>masnad</i>, and gave <i>khil&rsquo;ats</i> to the officers [of the
port], and re-established them in their respective situations; to the
servants and slaves I gave promotion. To those people who had come as
an escort from the temple, I gave presents and gratuities, and having
bestowed dresses on their officers, I dismissed them. Then having taken
with me jewels of great value, and pieces of fine cloth, and shawls,
and brocaded stuffs and goods, and rarities of every region, and a
large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6591" href="#xd26e6591" name=
"xd26e6591">231</a>]</span>sum of money as a
<i>naz&#817;ar</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6595src" href=
"#xd26e6595" name="xd26e6595src">83</a> for the king, and for the
nobles, according to their respective ranks, and for the priests and
priestesses, to be divided among them, after one week I went to the
idol-temple and laid the presents before the old woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave me another <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> of dignity,
and a title. I then went to the audience of the king, and presented my
<i>pesh-kash</i>. I addressed his majesty [on the best means] to remove
the evil consequences of whatever acts of tyranny and injustice the
[former] governor of the port had committed. For this reason, the king,
the nobles, and the merchants were all well pleased with me, and the
king showered many favours on me, and having given me a
<i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> and a horse, he bestowed on me a title and a
<i>j&#257;-g&#299;r</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6618src" href=
"#xd26e6618" name="xd26e6618src">84</a> with other dignities and
honours. When I came out from the royal presence, I gave the servants
and attendants so much, that they all began to pray [for my welfare].
In short, I became very happy in my condition; and I passed my days in
that country in extreme ease and felicity, after marrying the princess;
and I offered up thanks to God [for the happiness I enjoyed]. The
inhabitants were quite happy through the equity of my administration;
and once a month I used to go to the temple and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6624" href="#xd26e6624" name=
"xd26e6624">232</a>]</span>king&rsquo;s levee; his majesty, from time
to time, conferred on me additional promotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, he enrolled me as one of his privy counsellors, and
did nothing without my advice; my life began to pass in extreme
delight; but God only knows that I often thought on these two brothers
[and was anxious to know] where they were and how they were. After the
space of two years, a <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i> of merchants arrived at
the port from the country of <i>Zerb&#257;d</i>, and they were all
bound for Persia; they wished to return to their own country by sea. It
was the rule at that port, that whenever a <i>k&#257;rav&#257;n</i>
arrived there, the chiefs of the <i>k&#257;rav&#257;n</i> used to
present to me as a <i>naz&#817;ar</i> some rare presents and
curiosities of different countries. On the day following, I used to go
to [the chief&rsquo;s] place of residence, and to levy ten per cent. on
the value of his goods by way of duty; after which, I gave him
permission to depart. In the same manner, those merchants from
<i>Zerb&#257;d</i> likewise came to wait on me, and brought with them
presents beyond value; the second day I went to their tents. There I
perceived two men dressed in tattered old clothes, who bore packages
and bundles on their heads, right into my presence. After I had
examined [the packages], they carried them back; they laboured hard,
and attended constantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at them with great attention, and perceived they
were, indeed, my two brothers. At that time, shame and pride would not
allow me to see them in such servitude. When I returned home, I desired
my servants to bring those two men to me; when they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6649" href="#xd26e6649" name=
"xd26e6649">233</a>]</span>brought them, I had clothes made up for
them, and kept them near me. But these incorrigible villains again laid
a plan to murder me. One day at midnight,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6651src" href="#xd26e6651" name="xd26e6651src">85</a> finding all
off their guard, they came like thieves to the head of my bed. I had
maintained a guard at my door from apprehensions for my life, and this
faithful dog was asleep at the side of my bed; but the moment they drew
their swords from the scabbard, the dog first barked, then flew at
them; the noise he made awaked all; I, also alarmed, started up. The
guards seized them, and I knew them to be themselves all over. Every
one began to execrate them, [and said] &lsquo;notwithstanding all this
kindness, how infamously they have behaved!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O king, peace be upon you, I also became at last alarmed [for
my life]. There is a common saying, &lsquo;That the first and second
fault may be pardoned, but the third punished.&rsquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6662src" href="#xd26e6662" name="xd26e6662src">86</a> I
determined then, in my own heart, to confine them; but if I had put
them in the prison, who would have taken care of them? They might have
perished from want of food and drink, or they might have contrived more
mischief. For this reason, I have confined them in a cage, that they
may be always under my own eye, then my mind will be at rest; lest
being absent from my sight, they may hatch further wickedness. The
honour and esteem which I evince towards this dog, are on account of
his loyalty and fidelity. O, great God, a man without gratitude is
worse than a faithful brute! These were the past events of my life,
which I have related to your majesty, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6665" href="#xd26e6665" name="xd26e6665">234</a>]</span>now,
either order me to be put to death, or grant me my life; to the king
command belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this narrative,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6670src" href=
"#xd26e6670" name="xd26e6670src">87</a> I praised that man of honour,
and said, your kindness has been uninterrupted, and there has been no
limits to these fellows&rsquo; shameless and villainous conduct; so
true is it, &ldquo;That if you bury a dog&rsquo;s tail for twelve
years, it will still remain crooked as ever.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6673src" href="#xd26e6673" name="xd26e6673src">88</a> After
this, I asked the <i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> the history of those twelve
rubies which were in the dog&rsquo;s collar? He replied, &ldquo;May the
age of your majesty be a hundred and twenty years! After I had been
three or four years governor of that port, I was sitting one day on the
top of my house, which was high, for the purpose of viewing and
enjoying the sea and plain beneath. I was looking in all directions,
when suddenly, I perceived two human figures, who were coming along
from one side of the wood, where there was no high road. Having seized
a telescope, I looked at them, and saw they were of a strange
appearance: I speedily sent some mace-bearers to call them [to my
presence.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they came, I perceived they were a man and a woman. I
sent the woman into the seraglio to the princess, and called the man
before me; I saw he was a youth of twenty or twenty-two years of age,
whose beard and mustaches had commenced [growing;] but the colour of
his face had become black as that of the <i>taw&#257;</i>.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6684src" href="#xd26e6684" name=
"xd26e6684src">89</a> The hair of his head, and the nails of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6692" href="#xd26e6692" name=
"xd26e6692">235</a>]</span>fingers owing to the heat of the sun were
greatly grown, and he looked like a man of the woods. He held on his
shoulder a boy of about three or four years old, and two sleeves of a
garment, filled [with something], were suspended like a collar round
his neck; he cut a strange appearance, and was oddly dressed, I was
greatly surprised, and asked him, &lsquo;O, friend, who art thou, and
of what country art thou the inhabitant, and in what a strange
condition do I see thee?&rsquo; The young man began to weep bitterly,
and taking off the two filled sleeves from around his neck, he laid
them before me, and cried out, &lsquo;Hunger, hunger! for God&rsquo;s
sake give me something to eat; I have subsisted for a long while on
roots and herbs, and there is not a particle of strength remaining in
me.&rsquo; I instantly ordered him some bread, meat, and wine; he began
to devour them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meantime, the eunuch brought from my haram several
other bags which he found on [the stranger&rsquo;s wife.] I ordered
them all to be opened, and saw that they contained precious jewels of
every kind, each of which was equal in value to the amount of the
king&rsquo;s revenue; each one was more valuable than another in
weight, shape and brilliancy; and the whole apartment was illuminated
with variegated colours, from the reflection of their different
coloured rays. When the young man had eaten something, and drank a cup
of wine, his senses returned; I then asked him, &lsquo;where did you
get these stones?&rsquo; He answered, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6696" href="#xd26e6696" name="xd26e6696">236</a>]</span>&lsquo;My
native country is <i>Az&#817;urb&#257;&#299;j&#257;n</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6701src" href="#xd26e6701" name=
"xd26e6701src">90</a> Having separated from my home and parents in my
infancy, I have undergone many hardships; I was for a long while buried
alive, and have often escaped from the claws of the angel of
death.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;pray, young man, give me the details that
I may fully comprehend [your story].&rsquo; Then he began to relate his
adventures as follows:&mdash;&rsquo;My father was a merchant, and he
used to travel constantly to <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i>, China,
<i>K&#863;hat&#804;&#257;, R&#363;m,</i> and Europe. When I was ten
years of age, my father set out for <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i>, and
wished to take me with him. Although my mother and various aunts
remarked that I was yet a child, and not old enough to travel; my
father did not mind them, and said, &ldquo;I am now old; if he is not
instructed under my own eye, I will carry the regret with me to my
grave; he is the son of a man, and if he does not learn now, when will
he learn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Saying this, he took me with him, in spite of
their entreaties, and we set out. The journey was performed in health
and safety, and when we arrived in <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i>, we sold
some of our goods there, and taking some rarities with us from thence,
we set out for the country of <i>Zerb&#257;d</i>. This journey was
likewise performed in safety; there also we sold and bought goods, and
embarked on board a ship, to return the quicker to our country. One
day, about a month after, we were overtaken by a storm and hurricane,
and the rain began to fall in torrents; the whole earth and sky became
dark as a mass of smoke, and the rudder broke; the pilot and master
began to beat <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6722" href=
"#xd26e6722" name="xd26e6722">237</a>]</span>their heads; for ten days
the winds and waves carried us where they pleased; the eleventh day the
ship having struck against a rock, went to pieces. I did not know what
became of my father, our servants and our goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I found myself on a plank, which floated for
three days and nights beyond any control [of mine]. On the fourth day
it reached the shore. I had just life enough remaining. I got off the
plank, crawled along on my knees. I some how or other reached the dry
land. I saw some fields at a distance, and many people were assembled
there; but they were all black, and as naked as the day they were born;
they said something to me; but I did not understand their language in
the least. It was a field of the <i>chan&#257;</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6728src" href="#xd26e6728" name="xd26e6728src">91</a> pulse;
the men, having lighted a large fire were parching the ears [of
<i>chan&#257;</i>] and eating them; and some houses also appeared [near
the spot]. Perhaps this was their usual food, and that they lived in
those houses; they made signs to me also that I should eat. I plucked
up some of the <i>graum</i>, roasted it, and began to toss it into my
mouth; and having drank a little water, I laid down to sleep in a
corner of the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;After some time, when I awoke, a man, from
among them came to me, and began to show me [by signs] the road; I
plucked up some more of the <i>graum</i>, and followed the road [he
pointed out]. A great level plain appeared before me, vast as the plain
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6748" href="#xd26e6748" name=
"xd26e6748">238</a>]</span>the day of judgment.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6750src" href="#xd26e6750" name="xd26e6750src">92</a> I
proceeded, eating the <i>graum</i> as I went; after four days, I
perceived a fort; when I went near it, then I saw it was a very high
fort, all built of stone, and each side of which was two <i>kos</i> in
length, and the door was cut out of a single stone, and had a large
lock attached; but I could see no trace of any human being. I proceeded
on from thence and saw a hillock, the earth of which was in colour
black as <i>surma</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6766src" href=
"#xd26e6766" name="xd26e6766src">93</a> when I passed over the hillock,
I saw a large city, surrounded with a rampart with bastions at regular
intervals; and a river of great width flowed on one side of the city.
Proceeding on, I reached a gate, and invoking God, I entered it. I saw
a person who was dressed in the garment of the people of Europe, and
seated on a chair; the moment he saw I was a foreign traveller, and
heard me invoke God, he desired me to advance. I went up to him, and
made him a <i>sal&#257;m</i>; he returned my salutation with great
kindness, and laid on the table instantly some bread and butter, and a
roast fowl and wine, and said, &ldquo;Eat thy belly full.&rdquo; I ate
a little, and drank [some of the wine], and fell sound asleep. When the
night came, I opened my eyes, and washed my hands and face; he gave me
again something to eat, and said, &ldquo;O son, relate thy
story.&rdquo; I told him all that had happened to me. He then said,
&ldquo;Why art thou come here?&rdquo; I became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6775" href="#xd26e6775" name=
"xd26e6775">239</a>]</span>vexed, and replied, &ldquo;Perhaps thou art
mad; after hardships of long duration, I have at last seen the
appearance of [human] dwellings. God has conducted me so far, and thou
askest me why I am come here.&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Go and rest
thyself now; I will tomorrow tell thee what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;When the morning came he said to me,
&ldquo;There are in this room a spade, a sieve, and a leather bag;
bring them out.&rdquo; I said to myself, God knows what labour he will
make me undergo because he has made me eat of his bread; having no help
for it, I took up those articles and brought them to him. He then
ordered me to go to the black hillock [I had passed] and dig a hole a
yard deep, and &ldquo;whatever you find in it pass it through this
sieve; whatever cannot pass through, put it in the leather bag, and
bring it to me.&rdquo; I took all those implements and went there, and
having dug as much [as I was ordered], I passed it through the sieve,
and put what remained into the bag, [as directed]; I then saw they were
all precious stones of different colours, and my eyes were dazzled with
their brilliancy. In this manner I filled the bag up to the mouth, and
carried it to that person; on seeing it, he said, &ldquo;Whatever is in
the bag take it for thyself, and go away from hence; for thy stay in
this city will not do thee good.&rdquo; I gave for answer, &ldquo;Your
worship has, on your part, done me a great favour by giving me these
stones and pebbles; but of what use are they to me? When I become
hungry, I shall not be able to eat them nor to fill my belly; and if
you give me more of them, what use will they be to me?? That person
smiled, and said, &ldquo;I pity thee, for thou, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6779" href="#xd26e6779" name=
"xd26e6779">240</a>]</span>like me, art an inhabitant of the kingdom of
Persia; for this reason I advise thee [against remaining here],
otherwise it rests with thee. If thou art determined, at all hazards,
to enter this city, then take my ring with thee; when thou reachest the
centre of the market place, thou wilt find sitting there a man with a
white beard&mdash;his face and general appearance are very like
mine&mdash;he is my eldest brother&mdash;give him this ring&mdash;he
will then take care of thee; act conformably to what he says, otherwise
thou wilt lose thy life for nothing; my authority only extends as far
as this; I have no entrance into the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I took the ring from him, and, saluting him,
took my leave. I entered the city, and saw it was a very elegant place;
the streets and market-places were clean and the men and women without
concealment were buying and selling among themselves, and were all well
dressed. I continued advancing on, and viewing sights. When I reached
the four cross roads of the market place, such a crowd there was, that
if you threw a brass plate, it would have skimmed over the heads of the
people. The multitude were so close to each other, that one could with
difficulty make his way through. When the concourse became less, I,
pushing and jostling, advanced forward. I saw at last the person
[described], seated on a chair, and a <i>chumm&#257;k</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6785src" href="#xd26e6785" name=
"xd26e6785src">94</a> set with precious stones lay before him. I
approached him, made him my <i>sal&#257;m</i>, and gave him the ring;
he looked at me with a look of anger, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6796" href="#xd26e6796" name="xd26e6796">241</a>]</span>said,
&ldquo;Why hast thou come here, and plunged thyself in calamity? Did
not my foolish brother forbid thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I replied, &ldquo;he did forbid me, but I did
not mind him.&rdquo; I then related to him all my adventures from
beginning to end. That person got up, and taking me with him, he went
towards his own house; his residence appeared like the abode of a king,
and he had many servants and attendants. When he had retired to his
private apartment and sat down, he said with mildness, &ldquo;O son!
what folly hast thou committed, that on thine own feet thou hast walked
to thy grave? What unfortunate blockhead ever comes to this enchanted
city?&rdquo; I answered, I have already fully related to you my
history; now indeed fate has brought me here; but do me the kindness to
enlighten me on the customs and ways of this place, then shall I know
for what reasons you and your brother have dissuaded me from staying
here.&rdquo; The good man answered, &ldquo;The king and all the nobles
of this city have been excommunicated; strange are their manners and
religion! In an idol temple here there is an idol, from whose belly the
devil tells the name, sect, and faith of every individual; so, whatever
poor traveller arrives here, the king has information of it; and he
conveys the stranger to the pagoda, and makes him prostrate himself
before the idol. If he prostrates himself, it is well; otherwise, they
cause the poor wretch to be immersed in the river; and if he attempts
to escape from the river, his private parts<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6800src" href="#xd26e6800" name="xd26e6800src">95</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6814" href="#xd26e6814" name=

"corr" id="xd26e6816" title="Source: degreee">degree</span> that he has
to drag them along the ground. Such enchantment [has God] ordained in
this city. I feel pity for thee on account of thy youth; but for thy
sake I am going to execute a scheme I have formed that thou mayest be
able to live at least a few days, and be saved from this
calamity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I asked, &ldquo;What is the nature of the
project [you have formed]? impart it to me.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;I
mean to have thee married; and to get thee the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter for thy wife.&rdquo; I gave for
answer, &ldquo;How can the <i>waz&#299;r</i> give his daughter to a
wretch so poor and destitute as myself? Will it be when I embrace his
faith? This is what I never can do.&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;The
custom of this city is, that whoever prostrates himself before the
idol, if he be a beggar and demand the king&rsquo;s daughter, the king
must deliver her up to him in order to gratify his wish, and that they
may not grieve him. Now I am in the king&rsquo;s confidence, and he
esteems me, for which reason all the nobles and officers of state of
this place respect me. In the course of every week, they go twice to
the pagoda on a pilgrimage, and there they perform their worship; so
they will all assemble there to-morrow, and I will carry thee with
me.&rdquo; Saying this, he gave me something to eat and drink, and sent
me away to sleep. When the morning came, he took me with him to the
pagoda; when we arrived there, I saw that people were going to and fro,
and performing their devotions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6827" href="#xd26e6827" name="xd26e6827">243</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The king and nobles in front of the idol, near
the priests, with heads uncovered, were respectfully seated; also
unmarried girls and handsome boys, like <i>H&#363;r</i> and
<i>G&#863;hilm&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6835src" href=
"#xd26e6835" name="xd26e6835src">96</a> were drawn up in lines on the
four sides. The good old man spoke to me and said, &ldquo;Now do
whatever I say.&rdquo; I agreed, and said, &ldquo;Whatever you command,
that I will perform.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;First, kiss the
king&rsquo;s hands and feet, then, lay hold of the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> dress.&rdquo; I did so. The king asked,
&ldquo;Who is this, and what has he to say?&rdquo; The man replied,
&ldquo;This young man is my relation, and he is come from far to have
the honour to kiss your majesty&rsquo;s feet, and with this
expectation, that the <i>waz&#299;r</i> will exalt him by [admitting
him] into his service, if the order of the great idol and your
majesty&rsquo;s approbation be [to that effect].&rdquo; The king said,
&ldquo;If he will embrace our faith and sect, and adopt our customs,
then it will be auspicious [for him].&rdquo; Immediately, [the drums
of] the <i>na&#7731;&#7731;&#257;r-k&#863;h&#257;na</i><a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6853src" href="#xd26e6853" name=
"xd26e6853src">97</a> of the pagoda struck up; and I was invested with
a rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i>; they then put a black rope round my
neck, and dragged me before the seat of the idol, and having made me
prostrate myself before it, they lifted me up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;A voice issued from the idol, saying, &ldquo;O
respected youth, thou hast done well to enter into my service; rely on
my mercy and favour.&rdquo; On hearing these words, all the people
prostrated themselves, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6865"
href="#xd26e6865" name="xd26e6865">244</a>]</span>began to roll on the
ground, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Long may you prosper! why should it not
be!&rdquo; When the evening came, the king and the <i>waz&#299;r</i>
mounted, and went to the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> house, and they made
over to me the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter according to their
rites and ceremonies; they gave a great dowry and presents with her,
and expressed themselves highly obliged, saying, that according to the
commands of the great idol, they had given her to me. They settled us
both in one house; when I saw that beauty, then [I perceived that] in
truth her beauty was equal to that of a fairy, perfect from top to toe.
All the beauties we have heard of, as peculiar to
<i>Padmin&#299;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e6878src" href=
"#xd26e6878" name="xd26e6878src">98</a> females, were centred in her. I
cohabited with her without ceremony, and experienced great delight. In
the morning, after having bathed, I waited on the king; he bestowed on
me the <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> of marriage, and ordered that I
should always attend his levee; at last, after some days, I became one
of his majesty&rsquo;s counsellors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The king used to be much pleased with my
society, and often gave me presents and rich
<i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;ats</i>, although I was rich in worldly treasures,
for my wife possessed so much gold property and precious stones, that
they exceeded all bounds and limits. Two years passed in extreme
delight and ease. It happened that [my wife] the
<i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i> daughter, became pregnant; when the seventh
and eighth months had passed, and she entered her full time, the pains
came on; the nurse and midwife came, and a dead child was brought
forth; its poison infected the mother, and she also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6898" href="#xd26e6898" name=
"xd26e6898">245</a>]</span>died. I became frantic with grief, and
exclaimed, what a dreadful calamity has burst upon me! I was seated at
the head of the bed, and weeping; all at once the noise of lamentations
spread through the whole house, and women began to pour in [upon me]
from all sides. Each as she entered, struck one or two blows with her
hands on my head, and stood before my face, and began to weep. So many
women were assembled [round me], that I was perfectly hidden among
them, and nearly expiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In the mean time, some one from behind seized
me by the collar, and dragged me along; I looked up, and saw it was the
same man of Persia who had married me [to the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i>
daughter]. He exclaimed, &ldquo;O blockhead! for what art thou
weeping?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;O cruel! what a question thou askest!
I have lost my empire, and the repose of my house is utterly gone, and
thou demandest why I weep!&rdquo; He said, with a smile, &ldquo;Now
weep on account of thy own death; I told thee at first, that perhaps
thine evil fate had led thee here [to perish]; so it has turned out;
now, except death, thou hast no release.&rdquo; At last, the people
seized me, and led me to the pagoda; I saw that the king, the nobles,
and thirty-six tribes of his subjects were assembled there; the wealth
and property of my wife were all collected there; whatever article any
one&rsquo;s heart desired, he took; and put down its price in cash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In short, all her property was converted into
specie; with this specie precious stones were purchased, and locked up
in a small box; they then filled a chest with bread, sweetmeats, roast
meat, dried and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6907" href=
"#xd26e6907" name="xd26e6907">246</a>]</span>green fruits, and other
eatables; and they put the corpse of my wife into another chest, and
slung both the chests across a camel; they mounted me on it, and put
the box of precious stones in my lap. All the <i>Br&#257;hmans</i> went
before me singing hymns and blowing their shells, and a crowd for the
purpose of wishing me joy came on behind. In this manner I was
conducted out of the city, through the same gate by which I entered the
first day. The moment when the same keeper of the gate saw me, he began
to weep, and said, &ldquo;O unfortunate, death-seized [wretch]! thou
wouldst not listen to me, but by entering this city thou hast lost thy
life for nothing! It is not my fault; I did dissuade thee.&rdquo; He
said this to me; but I was so confounded, that I could not use my
tongue to reply to him; nor were my senses in their right place, to
foresee what would become of me at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;They conducted me at last to the same fort, the
door of which I had seen shut the first day [I entered this country].
The lock was opened with the assistance of many people united, and they
carried in the corpse and the chest of food. A priest came up to me,
and began to console me, saying, &ldquo;Man is born one day, and one
day dies; such is the [mode of] transmigration in this world; now
these, thy wife, thy son, thy wealth, and forty days&rsquo; food are
placed here; take them, and remain here until the great idol is
favourable to thee.&rdquo; In my wrath I wished to curse the idol, the
inhabitants of that place, and their manners and customs, and to
inflict blows and buffets on that priest. That same man of Persia in
his own tongue, forbade me, and said, &ldquo;Take care, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6914" href="#xd26e6914" name=
"xd26e6914">247</a>]</span>do not on any account utter a word; if you
should say anything whatever, they will burn you immediately. Well,
whatever was in your destiny, that has taken place: rely now on the
mercy of God; perhaps He will deliver you alive from this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In short, all of them, having left me by
myself, went out of that fortress, and shut the door. At that moment I
wept bitterly at my solitary and helpless state, and began to kick the
corpse of that woman, saying, &ldquo;O cursed corpse, if thou wast to
perish in child-birth, why didst thou marry and become pregnant?&rdquo;
After thoroughly beating her, I again sat silent. In the meantime, the
day advanced, and the sun became very hot; my brains began to boil, and
I was dying by reason of the stench. On whatever side I looked, I saw
the bones of the dead, and boxes of precious stones in heaps. I then,
having gathered some old chests together, placed them over each other,
so that there might be a shed against the heat of the day, and the dews
of the night. I began to search for water, and on one side I saw
something like a cascade, which was cut out of stone in the wall of the
inclosure, and had a mouth like a pot. In short, my life was
[sustained] for some time on the food [they had left with me], and the
water [I had found.]</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;At last, the victuals were exhausted, and I
became alarmed and complained to God. He is so beneficent that the door
of the inclosure opened and another corpse was brought in; an old man
accompanied it. When, having left him also, they went away, it came
into my head to kill the old man, and take possession of his chest of
provisions. So, having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6920" href=
"#xd26e6920" name="xd26e6920">248</a>]</span>taken up the leg of an old
chest, I went up to him; he was, poor wretch, sorely perplexed, seated
with his head resting on his knees. I came behind him, and struck him
such a blow, that his skull was fractured and his brains came out, and
he instantly resigned his soul to God. I seized his stock of
provisions, I began to live on it. For a long while this was my way,
that whatever living beings came in with the dead, I used to kill the
former, and having taken their provisions, I fared plentifully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;After some time, a young girl once came with a
corpse; she was very handsome, and I had not the hard heart to kill her
[as had hitherto been my practice]. She espied me, and swooned away
through fear. I took up her stock of provisions, and carried it to
where I lived; but I did not eat it alone; when I was hungry, I used to
carry her some victuals, and we ate together. When the young girl
perceived that I did not molest her, her timidity lessened daily and
she became more familiar, and used to come to my shed. One day I asked
her her story, and who she was; she replied, &ldquo;I am the daughter
of the king&rsquo;s <i>wak&#299;li mut&#804;la&#7731;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6927src" href="#xd26e6927" name=
"xd26e6927src">99</a> and had been betrothed to my uncle&rsquo;s son.
On the day of the marriage night he was attacked with a colic, and was
in such agonies from the pain, that he expired in an instant;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6933src" href="#xd26e6933" name=
"xd26e6933src">100</a> they brought me here with his corpse and have
left me.&rdquo; She then asked to hear my story; I also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6939" href="#xd26e6939" name=
"xd26e6939">249</a>]</span>related the whole to her, and said,
&ldquo;God hath sent thee here for my sake.&rdquo; She smiled and
remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In this way mutual affection increased between
us in a short time; I taught her the principles of the
<i>Musalm&#257;n</i> faith, and made her repeat our <i>kalima</i>. I
then performed the marriage ceremony, and cohabited with her; she also
became pregnant and brought forth a son. Nearly three years passed in
this manner. When she weaned the child, I said to my wife, &ldquo;How
long shall we remain here, and how shall we get out from hence?&rdquo;
She replied, &ldquo;If God takes us out, then we shall get out;
otherwise we shall some day die here.&rdquo; I wept bitterly at what
she said, and at our confinement, and continuing to weep, I fell
asleep. I saw a person in my dream, who said to me, &ldquo;There is an
outlet through the drain; go thou forth.&rdquo; I started up with joy,
and said to my wife, &ldquo;Collect and bring with you all the old
nails and bolts which belonged to the rotten chests, that I may [with
their help] widen [the mouth of the drain].&rdquo; In short, I having
applied a large nail to the mouth of that drain, used to strike it with
a stone until I became quite tired; however, after a year&rsquo;s
labour, I widened the opening so much that a man could get through
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I then put the very finest of the precious
stones into the sleeves of the habits of the dead, and taking them with
us, we three got out through the opening [I had made]. I offered up
thanks to God [for our deliverance], and placed the boy on my
shoulders. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6951" href="#xd26e6951"
name="xd26e6951">250</a>]</span>It is a month since we quitted the high
road from fear, and have travelled through bye-paths of the woods and
mountains; when hunger attacked us, we fed on grass and leaves. I have
not strength left to say a word more; these are my adventures which you
have just heard,&rsquo; O mighty king,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6953src" href="#xd26e6953" name="xd26e6953src">101</a> I took
pity on his condition, and having sent him to the bath, I had him well
dressed, and made him my deputy. In my own house I had had several
children by the princess, but they died one after another, when young;
one son lived to five years of age, and then died; from grief for him
my wife died also. I was greatly afflicted, and that country became
disagreeable to me after her loss; my heart became quite sad, and I
determined to return to Persia. I solicited the king&rsquo;s leave to
depart, and got the situation of the governor of the port transferred
to the young man [whose story I have just related]. In the meantime the
king died also; I took this faithful dog and all my jewels and money
with me, and came to <i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>, in order that no one
should know the story of my brothers. I have become well-known as the
dog-worshipper; and owing to this evil fame, I to this day pay double
taxes into the exchequer of the king of Persia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It so happened that this young merchant went to
<i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>, and owing to him I have had the honour to
kiss your majesty&rsquo;s feet.&rdquo; I asked<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6970src" href="#xd26e6970" name="xd26e6970src">102</a> the
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> Is not this [young merchant] your son? He
answered, &ldquo;Mighty sire, he is not my son; he is one of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6979" href="#xd26e6979" name=
"xd26e6979">251</a>]</span>your majesty&rsquo;s own subjects; but he is
now my master or heir, or whatever you choose to call him.&rdquo; On
hearing this, I asked the young merchant, &ldquo;what merchant&rsquo;s
son art thou, and where do thy parents reside?&rdquo; The youth kissed
the ground, and beseeching pardon for his life, replied, &ldquo;This
slave is the daughter of your majesty&rsquo;s <i>waz&#299;r</i>; my
father came under the royal anger on account of this very
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja&rsquo;s</i> rubies, and your majesty&rsquo;s
orders were, that if in one year my father&rsquo;s words should not be
verified, he should be put to death. On hearing [the royal mandate], I
assumed this disguise and went to <i>Naish&#257;p&#363;r</i>; God has
conducted the <i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i>, together with the dog and
rubies, before your majesty, and you have heard all the circumstances;
I now am hopeful that my aged father may be released.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these circumstances from the
<i>waz&#299;rz&#257;d&#299;</i>, the <i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja</i> gave a
groan, and helplessly fell down. When rose water was sprinkled over his
face, he recovered his senses, and exclaimed, &ldquo;O, dire mishap!
that I should have come from such a distance, with such toil and
sorrows, in the hope that, having adopted the young merchant for my
son, I should make over to him by a deed of gift, all my wealth and
property, that my name might not perish, and every one should call him
<i>k&#863;hw&#257;ja-z&#257;da</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7006src"
href="#xd26e7006" name="xd26e7006src">103</a> but now my imaginations
have proved vain, and the affair has turned out quite the contrary. He,
by becoming a woman, has ruined the old man. I fell into female snares,
and now the saying may be applied to me, &lsquo;Thou remainedst at
home, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7012" href="#xd26e7012" name=

"noteref" id="xd26e7015src" href="#xd26e7015" name=
"xd26e7015src">104</a></p>
<p>To shorten my story, I took pity on agitation, and groans and
lamentations, and called him near me, and whispered in his ear some
glad tidings, and added, &ldquo;do not grieve; I will marry thee to
her, and, if God pleaseth, thou shalt have children from her, and she
shall [now] be thy master.&rdquo; On hearing these welcome words, he
became altogether comforted. I then ordered them to conduct the
<i>waz&#299;rz&#257;d&#299;</i> to the seraglio, and to take the
<i>waz&#299;r</i> out of prison, bathe him in the bath, dress him in
the <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> of restoration to favour,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7035src" href="#xd26e7035" name=
"xd26e7035src">105</a> and bring him quickly before me. When the
<i>waz&#299;r</i> arrived, I went to the end of the
<i>farsh</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7047src" href="#xd26e7047"
name="xd26e7047src">106</a> to receive him, and conceiving him my

the <i>waz&#299;rsh&#299;p</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7062src"
href="#xd26e7062" name="xd26e7062src">107</a> I conferred also titles

a happy hour, I married him to the <i>waz&#299;r&rsquo;s</i>
daughter.</p>
<p>In a few years, he had two sons and a daughter born to him. In
short, the eldest son is now <i>Malikut-Tujj&#257;r</i>, and the
youngest, the chief manager of my household. O <i>Darweshes</i>, I have

<p class="line">I am going to relate it in full detail, O,

</div>
<p class="first">This humble being is the prince of Persia; my father
was king of that country, and had no children except myself. In the
season of my youth, I used to play with my companions at
<i>chaupa&#7771;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7137src" href=
"#xd26e7137" name="xd26e7137src">2</a> cards, chess, and backgammon; or
mounting my horse, I used to enjoy the pleasures of the chase. It
happened one day, that I ordered my hunting party, and taking all my
friends and companions with me, we sallied forth over the plains.
Letting loose the hawks [of various sorts] on ducks and partridges, we
followed [them] to a great distance. A very beautiful piece of land
appeared in sight; as far as the view extended, for miles around, what
with the verdure and the red flowers, the plain seemed like a ruby.
Beholding this delightful scene, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7142" href="#xd26e7142" name="xd26e7142">255</a>]</span>we
dropped the bridles of our horses and moved on at a slow pace [admiring
the charming prospect]. Suddenly, we saw a black deer on the plain,
covered with brocade, and a collar set with precious stones, and a bell
inlaid with gold attached to its neck; fearless it grazed, and moved
about the plain, where man never entered, and where bird had never
flapped a wing. Hearing the sound of our horses&rsquo; hoofs, it
started, and lifting up its head, looked at us, and moved slowly
away.</p>
<p>On perceiving it, such became my eagerness that I said to my
companions, remain where you are, I will catch it alive, take care you
do not advance a step, and do not follow me. I was mounted on such a
swift horse, that I had often gallopped him after deer, and confounding
their bounds, had seized them one after another with my hand. I pushed
after it; on seeing me, it began to bound, and swiftly fled away; my
horse also kept pace with the wind, but could not overtake the very
dust it raised. The horse streamed with sweat, and my tongue also began
to crack from thirst; but there was no alternative. The evening was
approaching, and I did not know how far I had come, or where I was.
Having no other chance [of getting the animal], I employed stratagem
towards it, and having taken out an arrow from the quiver, I adjusted
my bow, drew the arrow to its full length, aimed it at its thigh, and
pronouncing the name of God, I let it fly. The very first arrow entered
its leg, and, limping away, it went towards the foot of the mountain. I
dismounted from my horse, and followed it on foot; it took to the
mountain, and I at the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7146"
href="#xd26e7146" name="xd26e7146">256</a>]</span>time gave it chase.
After many ascents and descents, a dome appeared; when I got near it, I
perceived a garden and a fountain; but the deer disappeared from my
sight. I was greatly fatigued, and began to wash my hands and feet [in
the fountain].</p>
<p>All at once the noise of weeping struck my ears, as issuing from the
dome, and as if some one was exclaiming, &ldquo;O, child, may the arrow
of my grief stick in the heart of him who hath struck thee; may he
derive no fruit from his youth, and may God make him a mourner like
me.&rdquo; On hearing these words, I went to the dome, and saw a
respectable old man, with a white beard, and well dressed, seated on a
<i>masnad</i>, and the deer lying before him; he was drawing the arrow
from its thigh, and uttering imprecations [on the shooter]. I made him
my <i>sal&#257;m</i>, and joining my hands together, I said,
&ldquo;Respectable sir, I have unknowingly committed this fault; I did
not know it [was your deer]; for God&rsquo;s sake pardon me.&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;You have hurt a dumb animal; if you have committed
this cruel act through ignorance, God will forgive you.&rdquo; I sat
down near him, and assisted him in extracting the arrow; we pulled it
out with great difficulty; and having put some balsam to the wound, we
let [the deer] go. We then washed our hands, and the old man gave me
some food to eat, which was then ready; after satisfying my hunger and
thirst, I stretched myself out on a four-footed bedstead.</p>
<p>After having fed well, I slept soundly through fatigue. In that
sleep, the noise of weeping and lamentation struck my ears; rubbing my
eyes, when I looked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7158" href=
"#xd26e7158" name="xd26e7158">257</a>]</span>round, then neither the
old man nor any one else was in that apartment. I lay alone on the bed,
and the room was quite empty. I began to look with alarm in all
directions, and perceived a <i>parda</i> in a corner which was down;
going to it, I lifted it up, and saw that a throne was placed there, on
which was seated an angelic woman of about fourteen years of age; her
face was like the moon, and her ringlets on both sides [of her head]
hung loose; she had a smiling countenance; and she was dressed like a
European, and with a most charming air; she was seated [on the throne]
and looking forward. The venerable old man lay prostrate before her,
with his head on her feet, and he was weeping bitterly, and he seemed
to have lost his senses. On seeing the old man&rsquo;s condition, and
the woman&rsquo;s beauty and perfection, I was quite lost, and having
become lifeless, I fell down like a corpse; the old man seeing my
senseless state, brought a bottle of rose water, and began to sprinkle
it over my face; when I recovered, I got up, and went up to the angelic
woman and saluted her; she did not in the least return my salute, nor
did she open her lips. I said, &ldquo;O lovely angel, in what religion
is it right to be so proud, and not to return a salute.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Although to speak little is
becoming, yet not so much so;</p>
<p class="line">If the lover is dying, even then she would not open her
lips.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">For the sake of Him who hath created thee, pray give
me an answer; I am come here by chance, and the pleasing of a guest is
a requisite duty.&rdquo; I talked much to her, but it was of no use;
she heard me, and sat silent like a statue. I then advanced, and laid
my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7170" href="#xd26e7170" name=
"xd26e7170">258</a>]</span>hand on her feet; when I touched them, they
felt quite hard; at last, I perceived that this beautiful object was
formed of stone, and that <i>&#256;z&#817;ur</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7174src" href="#xd26e7174" name="xd26e7174src">3</a> had formed
this statue. I then said to the idol-worshipping old man, &ldquo;I
struck an arrow in thy deer&rsquo;s leg, but thou hast with the dart of
love pierced my heart through and through; your curse has taken place;
now tell me the full particulars of these [strange circumstances]; why
hast thou made this talisman, and why, having left [human] habitations,
dost thou dwell in woods and mountains? Tell me all that has happened
to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I pressed him greatly, he said, &ldquo;This affair has indeed
ruined me; dost thou also wish to perish by hearing it?&rdquo; I
exclaimed, &ldquo;Hold, thou hast already made too many evasions;
answer to the purpose, or else I will kill thee.&rdquo; Seeing me very
urgent, he said, &ldquo;O youth, may God the Almighty keep every person
safe from the scorching flame of love; see what calamities this love
hath produced; for love, the woman burns herself with her husband, and
sacrifices her life;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7184src" href=
"#xd26e7184" name="xd26e7184src">4</a> and all know the story of
<i>Farh&#257;d</i> and <i>Majn&#363;n</i>; what wilt thou gain by
hearing my story? Wilt thou leave thy home, fortune and country, and
wander for nothing?&rdquo; I gave for answer, &ldquo;Cease, keep thy
friendship to thyself; conceive me now thy enemy, and if life is dear
to thee, tell me plainly [thy story].&rdquo; Perceiving there was no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7196" href="#xd26e7196" name=
"xd26e7196">259</a>]</span>alternative, his eyes filled with tears, and
he began to say, &ldquo;The following is this miserable wretch&rsquo;s
story:&mdash;This humble servant&rsquo;s name is <i>Ni&rsquo;m&#257;n
Saiy&#257;h&#803;</i>. I was a great merchant; arrived to these years,
I have traversed all parts of the world for the purpose of trade, and
have been admitted to the presence of all kings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once the fancy came into my mind that I had wandered over the
regions of the four corners [of the world], but never went to the
Island of the Franks,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7203src" href=
"#xd26e7203" name="xd26e7203src">5</a> and never saw its king, citizens
and soldiers&mdash;I knew nothing of its manners and customs&mdash;so
that I ought to go there also for once. I took the advice of my
acquaintances and friends, and resolved [on the voyage]; I took with me
some rarities and presents from various places, such as were fit for
that country, and collecting a <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i> of merchants,
we embarked on board a ship and set sail. Having favourable winds, we
reached the island in a few months and put up in the city. I saw a
magnificent city, to which no city could be compared for beauty. In all
the <i>b&#257;z&#257;rs</i> and streets the roads were paved and
watered; such was the cleanliness that a bit of straw could not be
seen; why then make mention of dirt? The buildings were of every
variety, and at night the streets were lighted, at intervals, by two
rows of lamps; without the city were delightful gardens, in which rare
flowers and shrubs and fruits were seen [in rich profusion],
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7215" href="#xd26e7215" name=
"xd26e7215">260</a>]</span>such as no where else could be [seen] except
in Paradise. In short, whatever I may say in praise of this
[magnificent city] would not exceed [the truth].</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arrival of our merchants was much talked of. A
confidential eunuch<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7220src" href=
"#xd26e7220" name="xd26e7220src">6</a> mounted on horseback, and
attended by many servants, came to our <i>&#7731;&#257;fila</i>, and
asked the merchants, &ldquo;Who is your chief?&rdquo; They all pointed
to me; the eunuch came to my place; I rose up to receive him with
respect, and we saluted each other; I seated him on the <i>masnad</i>,
and offered him the pillow; after which I asked him to tell me what was
the occasion which afforded me the honour of his visit; he replied,
&lsquo;The princess has heard that some merchants are arrived, and have
brought much merchandise, for which reason she has desired me to bring
them to her presence; so come, and take along with you whatever
merchandise may be fit for the courts of kings, and gain the happiness
of kissing her threshold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave for answer, &lsquo;To-day, indeed, I am greatly
fatigued; to-morrow I will attend her with my life and property;
whatever I have by me, I will present as a <i>naz&#817;ar</i> [to the
princess], and whatever pleases her, the same is her majesty&rsquo;s
property.&rsquo; Having made this promise, I gave him rosewater and
<i>betel</i>, and dismissed him. I called all the merchants near me,
and whatever rarities each had, we collected together, and those of my
own I took also, and went in the morning to the door of the royal
seraglio. The door-keeper sent word of my arrival, and orders came to
bring me to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7237" href="#xd26e7237"
name="xd26e7237">261</a>]</span>the presence; the same eunuch came out,
and taking my hand in his, he led me along, whilst we talked in
friendly converse. Having passed the apartments of the female
attendants of the princess, he conducted me into a noble apartment. O
friend, you will not believe it, but so beautiful was the scene, that
you might say the fairies had been let loose there with their wings
shorn. On whatever side I looked, there my sight became transfixed, and
my limbs were torn away [from under me]; I supported myself with
difficulty, and reached the royal presence. The moment I cast my eyes
upon the princess, I was ready to faint, and my hands and feet
trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I contrived, with some difficulty, to make my salutation.
Beautiful women were standing in rows to the right and left, with their
arms folded. I laid before the princess the various kinds of jewels,
fine clothes, and other rich rarities that I had brought with me; from
these she selected some, (inasmuch as they were all worthy of choice).
She was greatly pleased, and delivered them to her head-servant, and he
said to me, that their prices should be paid the next day, according to
the invoice. I made my obeisance, and was pleased within myself that
under this pretext I should have to come again the next day. When I
took my leave and came out, I was speaking and uttering words like
those of a maniac. In this state I came to the <i>serai</i>, but my
senses were not right; all my friends began to ask what was the matter
with me; I replied, that from going and returning so far, the heat had
affected my brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, I passed that night in tossing and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7246" href="#xd26e7246" name=
"xd26e7246">262</a>]</span>tumbling [about in my bed]. In the morning,
I went again and presented myself [to wait on the princess], and
entered the seraglio along with the confidential servant, and saw the
same scene I had seen the day before. The princess received me kindly,
and sent every one [present] away, each to his own occupation. When
there became a dispersion of them, she retired to a private apartment,
and called me to her. When I entered, she desired me to sit down; I
made her my obeisance, and sat down. She said, &lsquo;As you have come
here, and have brought these goods with you, how much profit do you
expect on them?&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;I had an ardent desire to see
your highness, which God hath granted, and now I have got all I wished;
I have acquired the prosperity of both worlds. Whatever prices are
marked in the invoice, half is the prime cost, and half profit.&rsquo;
She replied, &lsquo;No, whatever price you have marked down shall be
paid; moreover, you shall receive presents besides, on condition that
you will do one thing, which I am about to order you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied, &lsquo;This slave&rsquo;s life and property are at
your service, and I shall think as the happiness of my destinies if
they can be of any use to your highness; I will perform [what you
desire] with my life and soul.&rsquo; On hearing these words, she
called for a <i>kalam-d&#257;n</i>, wrote a note, put it into a small
purse made of pearls, wrapped the purse in a fine muslin handkerchief,
and gave it to me; she gave me likewise a ring which she took from off
her finger, as a mark [by which I might make myself known]; she then
said to me, &lsquo;On the opposite side [of the city] is a large
garden, its name is <i>Dil-kush&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;Delight of the
Heart.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7256" href=
"#xd26e7256" name="xd26e7256">263</a>]</span>Go you there. A person
named <i>Kaik&#863;husr&#363;</i> is the superintendent [of the
garden]; deliver into his hands the ring, and bless him for me, and ask
a reply to this note, but return quick, as if you ate your dinner there
and drank your wine here;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7261src" href=
"#xd26e7261" name="xd26e7261src">7</a> you will see what a reward I
shall give you for this service.&rsquo; I took my leave, and went along
inquiring my way. When I had gone about two <i>/kos</i>, I saw the
garden. When I reached it, an armed man seized me, and led me into the
garden gate. I saw there a young man with the looks of a lion; he was
seated on a stool of gold, with an air of state and dignity, having on
an armour [forged] by <i>D&#257;,&#363;d</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7271src" href="#xd26e7271" name="xd26e7271src">8</a> with breast
plates, and a steel helmet. Five hundred young men, holding each in his
hands a shield and sword, and equipped with bows and arrows, were drawn
up in a line, and ready [to execute his orders].</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made him my <i>sal&#257;m</i>, and he called me to him; I
delivered him the ring, and, paying him many compliments, I showed him
the handkerchief, and mentioned also the circumstance of having brought
him a note. The moment he heard me, he bit his finger with his teeth,
and slapping his head, he said, &lsquo;Perhaps your evil destiny hath
brought you here. Well, enter the garden; an iron cage hangs on a
cypress tree, in which a young man is confined; give him this note,
receive his answer, and return quickly.&rsquo; I immediately entered
the garden; what a garden it was! you might say that I had entered
alive into Paradise. Every individual parterre bloomed with variegated
flowers; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7279" href="#xd26e7279"
name="xd26e7279">264</a>]</span>the fountains were playing, and the
birds were warbling [on the trees]. I went straight on, and saw the
cage suspended from the tree, in which I perceived a very handsome
young man. I bent my head with respect, and saluted him, and gave him
the sealed and enveloped note through the bars of the cage. That young
man opened the note and read it, and inquired of me about the princess
with great affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had not yet done speaking, when an army of negroes
appeared, and fell on me on all sides, and began to attack me without
delay with their swords and spears; what could one single unarmed man
do? In a moment they covered me with wounds; I had no sensation or
recollection of myself. When I recovered my senses, I found myself on a
bed, which two soldiers were carrying along [on their shoulders]; they
were speaking to each other; one said, &lsquo;Let us throw the corpse
of this dead man on the plain; the dogs and crows will soon eat it
up.&rsquo; The other replied, &lsquo;If the king should make
investigation, and learn this circumstance, he will bury us alive, and
grind our children to paste; what! are our lives become a burthen to
us, that we should act so rashly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On hearing this conversation, I said to the two [ruffians]
Gog and Magog, &lsquo;for God&rsquo;s sake take some pity on me, I have
still a spark of life left; when I die, do with me what you please; the
dead are in the hands of the living;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7285src" href="#xd26e7285" name="xd26e7285src">9</a> but tell me
what has happened to me; why have I been wounded, and who are you? pray
explain thus much to me.&rsquo; They then having taken pity on me,
said, &lsquo;The young man who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7288"
href="#xd26e7288" name="xd26e7288">265</a>]</span>is confined in the
cage is the nephew of the king of this country; and his father was
previously on the throne. At the time of his death he gave this
injunction to his brother: &lsquo;My son, who is heir to my throne, is
as yet young and inexperienced; do you continue to guide the affairs of
state with zeal and prudence; when he is of age, marry your daughter to
him, and make him master of the whole empire and treasury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After saying this his majesty died, and the younger brother
became king; he did not attend to the [late king&rsquo;s] last
injunctions; on the contrary, he gave it out that [his nephew was] mad
and insane, and put him into a cage, and has placed such strict guards
on the four sides of the garden that no bird can there flap its wing;
and many a time he has administered to [his nephew] the poison called
<i>hal&#257;hal</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7295src" href=
"#xd26e7295" name="xd26e7295src">10</a> but his life is stronger and
the poison has had no effect. Now the princess and this prince are
lover and mistress; she is distracted at home, and he in the cage; she
sent him a love-letter by your hands; the spies instantly conveyed
intelligence [of this circumstance] to the king; a body of Abyssinians
were ordered out and treated you thus. The king has consulted his
<i>waz&#299;r</i> on the means of putting to death this imprisoned
prince, and that ungrateful wretch has persuaded the princess to kill
the innocent prince with her own hands in the king&rsquo;s
presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Let us go, that I may see this scene even in
my dying moments.&rsquo; They at last agreed [to my request], and the
two soldiers and myself, though wounded, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7303" href="#xd26e7303" name="xd26e7303">266</a>]</span>went to
the scene and stood in silence in a retired corner. We saw the king
seated on his throne; the princess held in her hand a naked sword; the
prince was taken out of the iron cage, and made to stand before [the
king]; the princess, becoming an executioner, advanced with the naked
sword to kill her lover. When she drew near the prince, she threw away
the sword and embraced him. Then that lover said to her, &lsquo;I am
willing to die thus; here, indeed, I desire thee,&mdash;there, also, I
shall wish for thee.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7305src" href=
"#xd26e7305" name="xd26e7305src">11</a> The princess said, &lsquo;I
have come, under this pretext to behold thee.&rsquo; The king, on
seeing this scene, became greatly enraged, and reproached the
<i>waz&#299;r</i>, and said, &lsquo;Hast thou brought me here to see
this sight?&rsquo; The [princess&rsquo;s] confidential servant
separated the princess from the prince, and conducted her to the
seraglio. The <i>waz&#299;r</i> took up the sword, and flew with rage
at the prince to end with one blow his unfortunate existence. As he
lifted up his arm to strike, an arrow from an unknown hand pierced his
forehead, so that [his head] was cleft in twain, and he fell down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king, seeing this mysterious event, retired into his
palace; and they put the young prince again into the cage, and carried
him to the garden; I likewise came out from where I was. On the road, a
man called me and conducted me to the princess; seeing me severely
wounded, she sent for a surgeon, and enjoined him very strictly,
&lsquo;cure this young man quickly, and perform the ablution of
recovery. Your welfare depends on it; as much care and attention as you
bestow on him, so many presents and favours you <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7316" href="#xd26e7316" name=
"xd26e7316">267</a>]</span>will receive from me.&rsquo; In short, the
surgeon used his skill and assiduity according to the princess&rsquo;s
injunctions, and at the end of forty days, having caused me to be
bathed and washed, he presented me to the princess. She asked me,
&lsquo;Is there now anything else left to be done.&rsquo; I replied,
that through her humanity I was quite recovered. The princess then gave
me a rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> and a large sum of money, as she
had promised; yea, she even gave me as much more, and then dismissed
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took all my friends and servants with me, and set out from
that country [to return home]. When I reached this spot, I desired all
of them to return to their native country, and I erected on this hill
this building, and got a statue made of the princess. I took up my
residence here, and having rewarded my servants and slaves according to
their respective merits, I dismissed them, saying, whilst I live, I
leave it to you to provide me with food; beyond this act, you are your
own masters. They supply me with subsistence from gratitude, and I,
with heart at ease, worship this statue; whilst I live, this will be my
sole [care and] employment; these are my adventures which you have just
heard.&rdquo; O, <i>Darweshes</i>! on hearing his story, I, having
thrown the <i>kafn&#299;</i> over my shoulders, and having put on the
habit of a pilgrim, set out with extreme desire to see the country of
the Franks. After long wandering over mountains and through woods, I
began to resemble <i>Majn&#363;n F&#257;rh&#257;d</i>.</p>
<p>At last, my strong desire carried me to the same [European] city
[where the old statue-worshipper had been]; I wandered through its
streets and lanes like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7335" href=
"#xd26e7335" name="xd26e7335">268</a>]</span>a lunatic, and I often
remained near the seraglio of the princess; but I could get no
opportunity to have an introduction to her. I was greatly vexed that I
should not obtain the object for which I had undergone such misery and
toil, and come so far. On day, I was standing in the
<i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> when all at once the people began to run away,
and the shopkeepers having shut up their shops, also fled. What crowds
there were [a moment before], and how desert the place became [all of a
sudden]! I soon perceived a young man rushing forward from a side
street; he was like <i>Rustam</i> in appearance, and roared like a
lion; he flourished a naked sword in each hand; he was in armour, with
a pair of pistols in his girdle, and kept muttering something to
himself like an inebriated maniac; two slaves followed him, clothed in
woollen, and bearing on their heads a bier covered with velvet of
<i>K&#257;sh&#257;n</i>.</p>
<p>On seeing this sight, I determined to proceed with it; those I met
dissuaded me from it, but I would not hear them. Pushing forward, the
young man went towards a grand mansion; I also went along with him. He
looked back, and perceiving me, he wished to give me a blow and cut me
in two; I swore to him that this was the very thing I wished, saying,
&ldquo;I forgive you my blood; relieve me by some means or other from
the misery of life, for I am grievously afflicted; I have knowingly and
voluntarily put myself in your way; do not delay [my execution].&rdquo;
Setting me determined to die, God infused compassion into his heart,
and his anger cooled, and he asked me with much kindness and
gentleness, &ldquo;Who art thou and why art thou tired of life?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7348" href="#xd26e7348" name=
"xd26e7348">269</a>]</span></p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;Sit down awhile that I may tell you; my story is
very long and tedious. I am caught in the claws of love, for which
reason I am desperate.&rdquo; On hearing this, he unfastened his waist
band, and having washed his hands and face, he took some food and gave
me some likewise. When he finished his meal, he said, &ldquo;Say what
has befallen thee?&rdquo; I related all the adventures of the old man
and the princess, and the cause of my going there, [i. e. to Europe].
On hearing them he wept at first, and then said, &ldquo;What numbers of
homes this unfortunate [princess] has ruined! Well, thy cure is in my
hands; it is probable that through the means of this guilty being thou
wilt attain thy wishes; do not give way to anxiety; be
confident.&rdquo; He then ordered the barber to shave me, and to apply
to me the bath; <a class="noteref" id="xd26e7351src" href="#xd26e7351"
name="xd26e7351src">12</a> his slave brought me a suit of clothes and
dressed me: then the young man said to me, &ldquo;This bier which thou
seest is that of the late young prince, who was confined in the iron
cage; another <i>waz&#299;r</i> murdered him at last through treachery;
he indeed has obtained release though he has been wrongfully slain. I
am his foster brother; I put that <i>waz&#299;r</i> to death with a
blow of my sword, and made the attempt to kill the king; but he
entreated mercy, and swore that he was innocent; I having spurned him
as a coward, allowed him to escape. Since then, my occupation has been
this, to carry the bier, in this manner, through the city, on the first
Thursday of every moon, and to mourn for the [murdered prince].&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7360" href="#xd26e7360" name=
"xd26e7360">270</a>]</span></p>
<p>On hearing these circumstances, from his mouth, I attained some
consolation, saying, &ldquo;If he should wish it, then my desires will
be accomplished; God has favoured me greatly, since he has made such a
mad man well inclined towards me; so true is it, that if God is
favourable, all goes well.&rdquo; When the evening came, and the sun
set, the young man took up the bier, and instead of one of the slaves,
he put it on my head and took me along with him. He said, &ldquo;I am
going to the princess, and will plead for thee as much as I am able; do
not thou open thy lips, but remain silent and listen.&rdquo; I replied,
&ldquo;Whatever you advise, I will strictly do; God preserve you, for
you feel pity on my case.&rdquo; That young man proceeded towards the
royal garden, and when we entered it, I perceived a marble platform of
eight sides, in an open space of the garden, on which was spread an
awning of silver tissue with pearl fringe, and erected on poles set
with diamonds; a rich brocade <i>masnad</i>, with pillows, was spread
under the awning. The bier was placed there, and we were both ordered
to go and sit under a tree [which he pointed out].</p>
<p>In a short time, the lights of flambeaux appeared, and the princess
herself arrived, accompanied by some female attendants before and
behind her; melancholy and anger were visible in her looks; she mounted
the platform and sat down [on the <i>masnad</i>]. The foster-brother
stood before her with folded arms, then sat down at a respectable
distance on a corner of the <i>farsh</i>. The prayer for the dead was
read; then the foster-brother said something; I having applied my ear,
was listening with attention. At last, he said, &ldquo;O princess
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7374" href="#xd26e7374" name=
"xd26e7374">271</a>]</span>of the world, peace be upon you! The prince
of the kingdom of Persia, hearing, in your absence, of your beauty and
excellence, has abandoned his throne, and becoming a pilgrim like
<i>Ibr&#257;h&#299;m Adham</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7379src"
href="#xd26e7379" name="xd26e7379src">13</a> he is arrived here, after
overcoming many difficulties and undergoing great fatigue. The pilgrim
hath quitted <i>Balk&#863;h</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7388src"
href="#xd26e7388" name="xd26e7388src">14</a> for thee; he hath wandered
for some time through this city in distress and misery; at last,
forming the resolution to die, he joined me; I attempted to alarm him
with my sword; he presented his neck, and conjured me to strike without
delay, adding, that was his wish. In short, he is firmly in love with
you; I have proved him well, and have found him perfect in every way.
For this reason I have mentioned him to you; if you take pity on his
case and be kind to him, as he is a stranger, it would not be doing too
much [on the part] of one who fears God and loves justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this speech, the princess said, &ldquo;Where is he? if he
is really a prince, then it does not signify, let him come before
us.&rdquo; The foster-brother got up and came [to where I was] and took
me with him. I, on seeing the princess, became exceedingly overjoyed,
but my reason and my senses departed. I became dumb; I had not power to
speak. The princess shortly after returned [to her palace], and the
foster-brother came to his own residence. When we reached his house, he
said, &ldquo;I have related all the circumstances [you mentioned] to
the princess from beginning to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7396"
href="#xd26e7396" name="xd26e7396">272</a>]</span>end, and have
likewise interceded for you; now do you go there every night without
fail and indulge in pleasure and joy.&rdquo; I fell at his feet; [he
lifted me up and] clasped me to his bosom. All the day, I continued
counting the hours until the evening came, that I might go and see the
princess. When the night arrived, I took leave of that young man, and
went to the princess&rsquo;s lower garden; I sat down on the marble
platform, reclining on my pillow.</p>
<p>A hour after, the princess came slowly, attended by one female
servant only, and sat down on the <i>masnad;</i> it was through my
happy destinies that I lived to see this day! I kissed her feet; she
lifted up my head, and embraced me, and said, &ldquo;Conceive this
opportunity as fortunate; mind my advice; take me from hence, and go to
some other country.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Come along.&rdquo; After
having thus spoken, we both got out of the garden, but we were so
confused, through wonder and joy, that we could not use our hands and
feet, and we lost our road; we went along, in another direction, but
found not a place of rest. The princess got angry, and said, &ldquo;I
am now tired, where is your house? hasten to get there; otherwise what
do you mean to do? My feet are blistered; I shall [be obliged to] sit
down somewhere on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;My slave&rsquo;s house is near; we have now
reached it; be easy in your mind, and march on.&rdquo; I indeed told a
falsehood, but I was at a loss where to take her. A locked door
appeared on the road; I quickly broke the lock, and we entered the
place; it was a fine house, laid out with carpets, and flasks full
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7405" href="#xd26e7405" name=
"xd26e7405">273</a>]</span>of wine were arranged in the recesses, and
bread and roast meat were ready in the kitchen. We were greatly
fatigued, and drank each of us, a glass of Portugal wine with our meat,
and passed the whole night together in mutual bliss. In this scene of
felicity when the morning dawned, an uproar was raised in the town that
the princess had disappeared. Proclamations were issued in every
district and street; and bawds and messengers were despatched with
orders, that wherever she was to be found, she might be seized [and
brought to the king]; and guards of royal slaves were posted at all the
gates of the city. Those guards received orders not to let an ant pass
without the royal permission; and that whoever would bring any
intelligence of the princess should receive a
<i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;at</i> and a thousand pieces of gold as a present.
The bawds roamed through the whole city and entered every house.</p>
<p>I, who was ill fated, did not shut the door. An old hag, the aunt of
Satan (may God make her face black), with a string of beads in her
hand, and covered with a mantle, finding the door open, entered without
fear, and standing before the princess, lifted up her hands and blessed
her, saying, &ldquo;I pray to God that he may long preserve you a
married woman, and that thy husband&rsquo;s turban may be permanent! I
am a poor beggar woman, and I have a daughter who is in her full time
and perishing in the pains of child-birth; I have not the means to get
a little oil which I may burn in our lamp; food and drink, indeed, are
out of the question. If she should die, how shall I bury her? and if
she is brought to bed, what shall I give <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7415" href="#xd26e7415" name="xd26e7415">274</a>]</span>the
midwife and nurse, or how procure remedies for the lying-in woman? it
is now two days since she has lain hungry and thirsty. O, noble lady!
give her, out of your bounty, a morsel of bread that she may eat the
same along with a drink of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The princess took pity on her, and called her near her, and gave her
four loaves, some roast meat, and a ring from her little finger,
saying, &ldquo;having sold this, make jewels [for your daughter] and
live comfortably; and come occasionally to see me, the house is
yours.&rdquo; The old hag having completely gained the object she came
in search of, poured heartfelt blessings on the princess, saluted her
and trotted off. She threw away the loaves and meat at the door, but
kept the ring snug, saying to herself, &ldquo;the clue to trace the
princess is now in my possession.&rdquo; As God wished to preserve us
from this calamity, just then the master of the house arrived; he was a
brave soldier, mounted on an Arab horse, with a spear in his hand, and
a deer hanging by the side of his saddle. Finding the door of his house
open, the lock broken, and the old hag coming out of it, he was
enraged, and seized her by the hair and dragged her to the house. He
tied both her feet with a rope, and hung her on the branch of a true
with her head down and her feet uppermost; so that in a short time the
old devil died in agonies. The moment I saw the soldier&rsquo;s looks,
I was overcome with such fear that I turned quite pale, and my heart
began to tremble with dread. That brave man seeing us both alarmed,
gave us assurances of safety, and added, &ldquo;You have acted very
imprudently; you have done the deed and left the door open.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7419" href="#xd26e7419" name=
"xd26e7419">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>The princess, smiling, said, &ldquo;The prince said it was the house
of his slave, and brought me here under a deception.&rdquo; The soldier
observed, &ldquo;The prince said truly, for all the people are the
slaves and servants of princes; all are reared and fed from their
favour and protection. This slave is yours without purchase; but to
conceal secrets is consonant to good sense. O, prince, you and the
princess&rsquo;s coming to this humble roof, and honouring me with your
presence, will be a source of happiness to me in both worlds; and you
have thus dignified your slave. I am ready to sacrifice my life for
you; in no way will I withhold either it or my property [from your
service]; you may repose here in confidence; there is now no danger. If
this vile bawd had gone away in safety, she would have brought calamity
[upon you]; remain here now as long as you please, and let this servant
know whatever you require; he will procure it. What is the king! angels
themselves shall have no tidings of your being here.&rdquo; The brave
fellow spoke such words of comfort, and gave such confidence, that we
became more easy in our mind. Then I spoke, &ldquo;Well said, you are a
brave fellow; when I am able, I will show you the return for this
kindness; what is your name?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;This
slave&rsquo;s name is <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i>. In short, for
the space of six months, he performed from his heart and soul all the
duty required, and we passed our time very comfortably.</p>
<p>One day, my country and my parents recurred to my recollection,
which made me pensive and melancholy. Seeing my thoughtful looks,
<i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i> joined his hands together, and stood
before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7431" href="#xd26e7431" name=
"xd26e7431">276</a>]</span>me,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7433src"
href="#xd26e7433" name="xd26e7433src">15</a> and began to say,
&ldquo;If on the part of this slave any failure has occurred in
performing his duty, then let the same be stated.&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, why mention this? you have behaved to us
in such a manner, that we have lived in this city as comfortably as any
one does in his mother&rsquo;s womb; for I had committed such an act
that every individual straw had become my enemy. Who was such a friend
to us, that we could have tarried here a moment? May God preserve you
in happiness! You are a brave man.&rdquo; <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> then said, &ldquo;If you are tired of this place, I
will conduct you in safety wherever you wish to go.&rdquo; I then said,
&ldquo;If I could reach my own country, I should see my parents; I am
in this state; Lord knows what may have been their condition. I have
attained the object for which I quitted my country; and it is proper I
should now return [to my relations]; they have no tidings of me,
whether I am dead or alive; [God knows] what sorrow they may feel in
their hearts.&rdquo; That brave man replied, &ldquo;It is very
proper,&mdash;let us go.&rdquo; Saying this, he brought a Turkish horse
for me, which could travel a hundred <i>kos</i> a-day, and a swift
quiet mare of unclipped wings<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7443src" href=
"#xd26e7443" name="xd26e7443src">16</a> for the princess, and made us
both mount; then putting on his cuirass and arming himself completely,
he mounted on his horse and said, &ldquo;I will go before, do you
follow me with full confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we came to the city gate, he gave a loud cry, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7448" href="#xd26e7448" name=
"xd26e7448">277</a>]</span>and with his mace broke the bolt, and
frightened the guards; he vociferated to them, &ldquo;Ye rascals, go
and tell your master that <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i> is
carrying off the princess <i>Mihrnig&#257;r</i>, and the prince
<i>K&#257;mg&#257;r,</i> who is his son-in-law; if he has any spark of
manhood, then let him come out and rescue her; do not you be saying
that I carried her off in silence and by stealth, otherwise let him
stay in the fort and enjoy his repose.&rdquo; This news soon reached
the king; he ordered the <i>waz&#299;r</i> and general to seize the
three rebellious ones, and bring them tied neck and heels to the royal
presence, and cut off their heads and lay them before the throne. After
a short time, a numerous body of troops appeared, and the heavens and
earth were darkened by a whirlwind of dust. <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> placed the princess and me on the abutment of an
arch of the bridge which, like the bridge of <i>Jaunp&#363;r</i>,
consisted of twelve arches, and he himself turned about, and pushed his
horse towards the troops; he rushed in among them like a growling lion;
the whole body was dispersed like a flock of sheep,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7469src" href="#xd26e7469" name="xd26e7469src">17</a> and he
penetrated to the two chiefs and cut off both their heads. When the
chiefs were killed, the troops dispersed, as the saying is, that
&ldquo;All depends on the head; when it is gone, all is lost.&rdquo;
The king came immediately to their assistance, with a body of armed
troops; <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i> completely defeated them
also.</p>
<p>The king fled; so true it is that &ldquo;God alone gives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7486" href="#xd26e7486" name=
"xd26e7486">278</a>]</span>victory;&rdquo; but <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> behaved so bravely, that perhaps even <i>Rustam</i>
himself could not have equalled his valour. When he saw that the field
of battle was cleared, and that no one remained to pursue him, and that
there was nothing to apprehend, he came confidentially to the place
where we were, and taking the princess and me along with him, he pushed
forward. The duration of the journey is rendered short; we reached the
boundaries of my country in a short time. I despatched a letter to the
king, (who was my father), mentioning my safe arrival; he was quite
rejoiced on reading it, and thanked God [for His goodness]. As the
withered plant revives by water, so the joyful tidings renovated his
drooping spirits; he took all his <i>am&#299;rs</i> with him, and
advanced for the purpose of receiving me as far as the banks of a large
river, and an order for boats [to cross us over] was issued to the
superintendent of rivers. I saw the royal train from the opposite bank;
from eagerness to kiss my father&rsquo;s feet, I plunged my horse into
the river, and swimming over, I rode up to the king; he clasped me with
eager fondness to his [paternal] bosom.</p>
<p>At this moment, another unforeseen calamity overwhelmed us. The
horse on which I was mounted was perhaps the colt of the mare on which
the princess rode, or they had been perhaps always together, for seeing
my horse plunge into the river, the mare became restive, followed my
horse, and likewise plunged into the river with the princess, and began
to swim. The princess being alarmed, pulled the bridle; the mare was
tender mouthed and turned over; the princess struggled, and sank with
the mare, so that not a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7499" href=
"#xd26e7499" name="xd26e7499">279</a>]</span>trace of either was ever
seen again. On seeing this circumstance, <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> dashed into the river on horseback to afford
assistance to the princess; he got into a whirlpool and could not
extricate himself; all his efforts with his hands and feet were vain,
and he also sank. The king seeing these sad circumstances, sent for
nets and had them thrown into the river, and ordered the boatmen and
divers [to look for the bodies]; they swept the whole river, but could
find nothing.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7504src" href="#xd26e7504"
name="xd26e7504src">18</a> O <i>Darweshes!</i> this dreadful occurrence
affected me so much that I became mad and frantic; I became a pilgrim,
and wandered about, ever repeating these words,&mdash;&ldquo;Such has
been the fate of these three; that you have seen, now view the other
side.&rdquo; If the princess had vanished or died anywhere, I should
then have some kind of consolation for my heart, for I would have gone
in search of her, or have borne the loss with patience; but when she
perished before my eyes [in this dreadful manner], I could not support
[the shock]. At last, I determined to perish with her in the stream,
that I might perhaps meet my beloved one in death.</p>
<p>I according plunged into that same river one night in order to drown
myself, and went up to the neck in the water; I was on the point of
stepping forward and diving down, when the same veiled horseman who
saved you two,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7512src" href="#xd26e7512"
name="xd26e7512src">19</a> came up and seized my arm; he consoled me,
and said to me, &ldquo;Be comforted; the princess and <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> are alive; why do you uselessly throw away your
life? such events do occur <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7521"
href="#xd26e7521" name="xd26e7521">280</a>]</span>in the world. Do not
despair of the help of God; if you live, you will some day or other
meet the two persons [for whom you are going to sacrifice your life].
Proceed now to the empire of <i>R&#363;m</i>; two other unfortunate
<i>Darweshes</i> are gone there already; when you meet them, you will
attain your wishes.&rdquo; O <i>Darweshes!</i> I am come here to you,
according to the advice of my heavenly Mentor; I firmly hope that each
of us will gain the desires of his heart. These have been this
pilgrim&rsquo;s adventures, which he hath related to you fully and
entirely. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7533" href="#xd26e7533"

<p class="first">The fourth <i>Darwesh</i> began with tears the
relation of his adventures in the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;The sad tale of my misfortunes now hear,</p>
<p class="line">Pay some attention, and my whole story hear;</p>

<p class="line">I will relate it all,&mdash;do you the reason

</div>
<p class="first">O, guides [to the path] of God,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7553src" href="#xd26e7553" name="xd26e7553src">1</a> bestow a
little attention. This pilgrim, who is reduced to this wretched state,
is the son of the king of China; I was brought up with tenderness and
delicacy, and well educated. I was utterly unacquainted with the good
and evil of this world, and imagined [my life] would ever pass in the
same manner. In the midst of this extreme thoughtlessness this sad
event took place; the king, who was the father of this orphan, departed
[this life]. In his last moments, he sent for his younger brother, who
was my uncle, and said to him, &ldquo;I now leave my kingdom and wealth
behind me, and am going to depart; but do you perform my last wishes,
and act the part of an elder. Until the prince, who is the heir to my
throne, has become of age, and has sense <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7559" href="#xd26e7559" name="xd26e7559">282</a>]</span>to govern
his kingdom; do you act as regent, and do not permit the army and the
husbandmen to be injured or oppressed. When the prince has arrived at
the years of maturity, give him advice, and deliver over to him the
government; and having married him to your daughter, <i>Roshan
Ak&#863;htar,</i> retire yourself from the throne. By this conduct, the
sovereignty will remain in my family, and no harm will accrue to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this speech, [the king] himself expired; my uncle became
ruler, and began to regulate the affairs of government. He ordered me
to remain in the seraglio, and that I should not come out of it until I
reached [the years of] manhood. Until my fourteenth year I was brought
up among the princesses and female attendants, and used to play and
frisk about. Having heard of [my intended] marriage with my
uncle&rsquo;s daughter, I was quite happy, and on this hope I became
thoughtless, and said to myself, that I shall now in a short time
ascend the throne and be married; &ldquo;the world is established on
hope.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7566src" href="#xd26e7566"
name="xd26e7566src">2</a> I used often to go and sit with
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, a negro slave, who had been brought up in my late
father&rsquo;s service, and in whom much confidence was [placed], as he
was sensible and faithful. He also had a great regard for me, and
seeing me advancing to the years of manhood, he was much pleased, and
used to say, &ldquo;God be praised, O prince, you are now a young man,
and, God willing, your uncle, the shadow of Omnipotence, will shortly
fulfil the injunctions [of your late father], and give you his
daughter, and your father&rsquo;s throne.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7572" href="#xd26e7572" name=
"xd26e7572">283</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day, it happened that a common female slave gave me, without
cause, such a slap, that the marks of her five fingers remained on my
cheek. I went, weeping, to <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>; he clasped me to his
bosom, and wiped away my tears with his sleeve, and said, &ldquo;Come,
I will conduct you to-day to the king; he will perhaps be kind to you
on seeing yon, and, conceiving you qualified [in years], he may give up
to you your rights.&rdquo; He led me immediately to my uncle&rsquo;s
presence; my uncle showed me great affection before the court, and
asked me, &ldquo;why are you so sad, and wherefore are you come here
to-day?&rdquo; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> replied, &ldquo;He is come here to
say something [to your majesty].&rdquo; On hearing this, he said of
himself, &ldquo;I will shortly marry the young prince.&rdquo;
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> answered, &ldquo;It will be a most joyful
event.&rdquo; The king immediately sent for the astrologers and
diviners into his presence, and with feigned interest asked them,
&ldquo;In this year what month, what day, and what hour is auspicious,
that I may order the preparations for the prince&rsquo;s
marriage?&rdquo; They perceiving what were [the king&rsquo;s real
wishes], made their calculations, and said, &ldquo;Mighty sire, the
whole of this year is unpropitious; no day in any of the lunar months
appears happy; if this whole year pass in safety, then the next is most
propitious for a happy marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king looked towards <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, and said,
&ldquo;Reconduct the prince to the seraglio, if God willing, after this
year is over, I will deliver up my trust to him; let him make himself
perfectly easy, and attend to his studies,&rdquo; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>
made his <i>sal&#257;m</i>, and taking me along with him, reconducted
me to the seraglio. Two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7595" href=
"#xd26e7595" name="xd26e7595">284</a>]</span>or three days after this,
I went to <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>; on seeing me, he began to weep; I was
surprised, and asked him, saying, &ldquo;My father, is all well? what
is the cause of your weeping?&rdquo; Then, that well wisher, (who loved
me with heart and soul), said, &ldquo;I conducted you the other day to
that tyrant; if I had known it, I would not have carried you
there,&rdquo; I was alarmed, and asked him, &ldquo;What harm has
occurred from my going? pray tell me truly,&rdquo; He then said,
&ldquo;All the nobles, ministers, and officers of state, small and
great, of your father&rsquo;s time, were greatly rejoiced on seeing
you, and began to offer up thanks to God, saying, &lsquo;Now, our
prince is of age, and fit to reign. Now, in a short time, the right
will devolve upon the rightful [heir]; then he will do justice to our
merits, and appreciate the length of our services.&rsquo; This news
reached the ears of that faithless wretch,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7601src" href="#xd26e7601" name="xd26e7601src">3</a> and entered
his breast like a serpent. He sent for me in private, and said,
&lsquo;O <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, act now in such a manner, that by some
stratagem or other the prince may be destroyed; and remove the dread of
his [existence] from my heart, that I may feel secure.&rsquo; Since
then I am quite confounded, for your uncle is become the enemy of your
life.&rdquo; When I heard this dreadful news from <i>Mub&#257;rak,</i>
I was dead without being murdered, and fell at his feet from fear of my
life, and said, &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, I relinquish my throne; by
any means, let my life be saved.&rdquo; That faithful slave lifted up
my head, clasped me to his breast, and said, &ldquo;There is no danger,
a thought has struck me; if it turns out well, then <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7613" href="#xd26e7613" name=
"xd26e7613">285</a>]</span>there is nothing to fear; whilst we have
life, we have everything. &ldquo;It is probable that, by this scheme
[of mine] your life will be preserved, and you will attain your
wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving me these hopes, he took me with him, and went to the
apartment where the deceased king, my father, used to sit and sleep;
and gave me every confidence. There a stool was placed; he told me to
lay hold of one of its legs, and taking hold of the other himself, we
removed the stool, and he lifted up the carpet that was beneath it, and
began to dig the floor. A window appeared suddenly, to which were
attached a chain and lock. He called me near him; I apprehended within
myself that he wished to butcher me, and bury me in the place he had
dug. Death appeared [in all its horrors] before my eyes; but having no
other alternative, I advanced slowly and in silence towards him,
repeating within myself my prayers to God. I then saw a building with
four rooms inside of that window, and in every room ten large vases of
gold were suspended by chains; on the mouth of each vase was placed a
brick of gold, on which was set the figure of a monkey inlaid with
precious stones. I counted thirty-nine vases of this kind in the four
rooms, and saw one vase filled with pieces of gold, on the mouth of
which there was neither the brick, nor the figure of the monkey, and I
also saw a vat filled to the brim with precious stones. I asked
<i>Mub&#257;rak,</i> &ldquo;O my father, what talisman is this? whose
place is this, and for what use are those figures?&rdquo; He replied,
&ldquo;The following is the story of those figures of monkeys which you
see:&mdash;Your father from his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7620" href="#xd26e7620" name="xd26e7620">286</a>]</span>youth
formed a friendship and kept up an intercourse with <i>Maliki
S&#257;di&#7731;</i>, who is the king of the <i>jinns</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, once every year, [his late majesty] used to
visit <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> and stay near a month with
him, having carried thither with him many kinds of essences,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7633src" href="#xd26e7633" name="xd26e7633src">4</a>
and the rarities of this country, [as a present]. When he took his
leave, <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> used to give him the figure
of a monkey made of emerald, and our king used to bring it and place it
in these lower rooms; no one but myself knew the circumstance. Once I
observed to your father, O mighty king, you carry with you thousands of
rupees&rsquo;-worth of rarities, and you bring back from thence the
figure of a lifeless monkey in stone; what is the advantage of this
[exchange] in the end? In answer to my question, he smiling, said,
&lsquo;Beware, and do not, in any way divulge this secret; the
information [you receive] is on this condition. Each one of these
lifeless monkeys which thou seest has a thousand powerful
demons<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7651src" href="#xd26e7651" name=
"xd26e7651src">5</a> at his command, ready to obey his orders; but
until I have the number of forty monkeys complete, so long are all
these of no use, and will be of no service to me.&rsquo; So one monkey
was wanting [to complete the efficient number] in that very year, when
the king died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this toil then has been of no avail, nor has the
advantage of it been displayed. O prince, I recollected this
circumstance on seeing your forlorn situation, and determined within
myself to conduct you by some <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7661"
href="#xd26e7661" name="xd26e7661">287</a>]</span>means or other to
<i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>, and mention to him your
uncle&rsquo;s tyranny. It is most likely that he, recollecting your
father&rsquo;s friendship for him, may give you the one monkey which is
wanting [to complete the number]; then, with their aid, you may get
your empire, and reign peaceably over China and
<i>M&#257;ch&#299;n,</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e7668src" href=
"#xd26e7668" name="xd26e7668src">6</a> and your life, at least, will be
secured by this proceeding, if nothing else can be done; I see no other
way to escape from the hands of this tyrant, except the plan I
propose.&rdquo; On hearing all these consoling circumstances from
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, I said to him, &ldquo;O friend, you are now the
disposer of my life; do whatever is best with regard to me.&rdquo;
Giving me every confidence, he went to the <i>b&#257;z&#257;r</i> to
buy some <i>&rsquo;it&#804;r</i> and <i>buk&#863;h&#363;r</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7689src" href="#xd26e7689" name="xd26e7689src">7</a>
and whatever he deemed fit to be carried [as a present for <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>].</p>
<p>The next day, he went to my impious uncle, who was a second
<i>Ab&#363;-Jahal</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7702src" href=
"#xd26e7702" name="xd26e7702src">8</a> and said, &ldquo;Protector of
the world, I have formed a plan in my heart for destroying the prince,
and if you order me, I will relate it.&rdquo; That wretch was quite
pleased, and said, &ldquo;What is the plan?&rdquo; Then
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> said, &ldquo;By putting him to death [here], your
majesty will be highly censured in every way; but I will take him out
to the woods, finish him, bury him, and return; no one will be
conversant [of the fact].&rdquo; On hearing this plan of
<i>Mub&#257;rak&rsquo;s</i>, the king said, &ldquo;It is an excellent
[plan]; I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7716" href="#xd26e7716"
name="xd26e7716">288</a>]</span>desire this, that he may not live in
safety; I am greatly afraid of him in my heart, and if thou relievest
me from this anxiety, then in return for that service thou shalt obtain
much; take him where thou wilt, and make away with him, and bring me
the welcome tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being in this manner at ease with regard to the king,
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> took me with him, and having also taken the
presents, he set out from the city at midnight, and proceeded towards
the north. For a whole month he went on without stopping; one night we
were trudging along, when <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> observed, &ldquo;God be
praised, we are now arrived at the end of our journey.&rdquo; On
hearing this exclamation, I said, &ldquo;O friend, what dost thou
say?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;O prince, do not you see the army of the
<i>jinns</i>?&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I see nothing except
you.&rdquo; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> then took out a box containing
<i>surma</i>, and with a needle applied to both my eyes the
<i>surma</i> of <i>Sulaim&#257;n</i>. I instantly began to see the host
of the <i>jinns</i> and the tents and encampments of their army; they
were all handsome, and well dressed. Recognising <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>,
they all embraced him, and spake to him facetiously.</p>
<p>Proceeding onwards, we at length reached the royal tents, and
entered the court. I saw they were well lighted, and stools of various
kinds were arranged in double rows, on which were seated men of
learning, philosophers, <i>darweshes</i>, nobles, and the officers of
state; servants of various grades with their arms across were in
waiting, and in the centre was placed a throne set with precious
stones, on which was seated with an air of dignity, the king, <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>, with a crown of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7757" href="#xd26e7757" name=
"xd26e7757">289</a>]</span>head, and clothed in a tunic set with
pearls. I approached him and made my salutation; he desired me with
kindness to sit down, and then ordered dinner; after having finished
[our repast], the <i>dastar-k&#863;hw&#803;&#257;n</i> was removed, and
he having looked towards <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, asked my story.
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> replied, &ldquo;This prince&rsquo;s uncle now
reigns in the room of his father, and is become the enemy of his life,
for which reason I have run off with him from thence, and have
conducted him to your majesty; he is an orphan, and the throne is his
due; but no one can do anything without a protector; with your
majesty&rsquo;s assistance, this injured [youth] may get his rights;
recollect the return due for his father&rsquo;s services, afford him
your assistance, and give him the fortieth monkey, that the number may
be completed, and the prince, having gained his rights [with their
aid],<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7769src" href="#xd26e7769" name=
"xd26e7769src">9</a> will pray for your majesty&rsquo;s long life and
prosperity; he has no other visible resource except your
majesty&rsquo;s protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing all these circumstances, <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>, after a pause, said, &ldquo;In truth, the
return for the deceased king&rsquo;s services, and his friendship for
me, are great; and, considering that this helpless prince is
overwhelmed with misfortunes, that he has quitted his lineal throne to
save his life, and is come as far as this, and has taken shelter under
the shadow of our protection, I shall in no way be wanting [to afford
him my assistance] as far as I am able, nor will I pass him over; but I
have an affair in hand; if he can do it and does <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7786" href="#xd26e7786" name=
"xd26e7786">290</a>]</span>not deceive me&mdash;if he executes it
properly, and acquits himself fully in the trial, I then promise that I
will be a greater friend to him than I was to the late king, his
father, and that I will grant him whatever he asks<span class="corr"
id="xd26e7788" title="Source: ,">.</span>&rdquo; I joined my hands, and
replied, &ldquo;This servant will most cheerfully perform as far as he
is able, whatever services your majesty may require; he will execute
them with prudence and vigilance, and without deceit, and think it a
happiness to him in both worlds.&rdquo; The king of the <i>jinns</i>
observed, &ldquo;You are as yet a mere boy, for which reason I warn you
so repeatedly, that you may not deceive me, and plunge yourself in
calamity.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;God, through the good fortune of
your majesty, will make it easy to me, and I will, as far as in me
lies, exert myself to your satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>, on hearing [these assurances],
called me near him, and taking out a paper from his pocket book, showed
it to me, and said, &ldquo;Search where you think proper for the person
whose portrait this is; find her out and bring her to me; when you find
out her name and place, go before her, and express great affection to
her from me; if you perform this service, then whatever expectations
you may have from me, I will exceed them in the performance; otherwise
you will be treated as you deserve.&rdquo; When I looked on that paper,
I perceived such a beautiful portrait in it, that a faintness came over
me; I supported myself with difficulty through fear, and answered,
&ldquo;Very well, I take my leave; if God favours me, I shall execute
what your majesty commands.&rdquo; Saying this, I took
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> with me, and bent my course towards the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7801" href="#xd26e7801" name=
"xd26e7801">291</a>]</span>woods. I began to wander from city to city,
from town to town, from village to village, and from country to
country, and to inquire of every one [I met] the name and place [of the
fair one whose portrait I had]; but no one said &ldquo;Yes, I know
her,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have heard of her from some one.&rdquo; I
passed seven years in this wandering state, and suffered every misery
and perplexity; at last, I reached a city which was populous, and
contained many grand edifices; but every living creature there was
repeating the great name,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7803src" href=
"#xd26e7803" name="xd26e7803src">10</a> and worshipping God.</p>
<p>I saw a blind beggar of <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i> begging alms, but
no one gave him a <i>kau&#7771;&#299;</i>, or a mouthful; I wondered at
it, and pitied him; I took out a piece of gold from my pocket, and gave
it to him; he took it, and said, &ldquo;O donor! God prosper you; you
are perhaps a traveller, and not an inhabitant of this city.&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;In truth, I have wandered distractedly for seven years;
I cannot find the smallest trace of the object for which I set out, and
have this day reached this city. The old man poured blessings on me,
and went on; I followed him; a grand building appeared without the
city; he entered it, and I also followed, and saw that here and there
the building had fallen down, and was out of repair.</p>
<p>I said to myself, &ldquo;This edifice is fit for princes; what an
agreeable place it will be when in repair? and now, through desolation,
what an appearance it has! but I cannot conceive why it is fallen into
ruin, and why this blind man lives in it.&rdquo; The blind man was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7819" href="#xd26e7819" name=
"xd26e7819">292</a>]</span>going on feeling his way with his stick,
when I heard a voice, as if some one was saying, &ldquo;O father, I
hope all is well; why have you returned so early to-day?&rdquo; The old
man, on hearing this question, replied, &ldquo;Daughter, God made a
youthful traveller have pity on my condition; he gave me a piece of
gold; it is many a-day since I have had a bellyful of good food. So I
have purchased meat, spices, butter, oil, flour, and salt; and I have
also procured such clothes for you as were necessary; cut them out, sew
them and wear them; and cook the dinner, that we may partake of it, and
then offer up our prayers for the generous man [who has been kind to
us]; although I do not know the desires of his heart, yet God knows and
sees all; and will grant the prayers of us destitute ones.&rdquo; When
I heard the circumstance of his severe fasting, I wished much to give
him twenty pieces of gold more; but looking towards the quarter from
whence the sounds came, I saw a woman who resembled exactly the
portrait I had. I drew it out and compared it, and perceived that there
was not a hairbreadth of difference. A deep sigh escaped from my bosom,
and I became senseless. <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> took me in his arms and sat
down, and began to fan me; I recovered a little sensation, and was
gazing at her, when <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> asked, &ldquo;What is the
matter with you?&rdquo; I had not yet answered him, when the beautiful
female said, &ldquo;O young man, fear God, and do not look at a strange
female;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7827src" href="#xd26e7827" name=
"xd26e7827src">11</a> shame and modesty are necessary to every
one.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7830" href="#xd26e7830"
name="xd26e7830">293</a>]</span></p>
<p>She spoke with such propriety that I became enchanted with her
beauty and manners. <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> comforted me greatly, but he
did not know the state of my heart; having no alternative, I called out
and said, &ldquo;O you creatures of God, and inhabitants of this place!
I am a poor traveller; if you call me near you, and give me some place
to put up in, it will be an important matter [for me].&rdquo; The old
man called me to him, and recognising my voice, he embraced me, and
conducted me to where the lovely woman was seated; she went and hid
herself in a corner. The old man asked me thus: &ldquo;Tell thy story;
why hast thou left thy home, and wandered about alone, and of whom are
you in search?&rdquo; I did not mention <i>Maliki
S&#257;di&#7731;&rsquo;s</i> name, nor did I say anything about him;
but thus told [my supposed tale]. &ldquo;This wretch is the prince of
China and <i>M&#257;ch&#299;n</i>; so that my father is still king; he
purchased from a merchant this picture for four <i>l&#257;k&#863;hs</i>
of rupees; from the moment when I beheld it, my peace of mind fled, and
I put on the dress of a pilgrim; I have searched the whole world, and
have now found the object here; the same is in your power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing these words, the old man heaved a heavy sigh, and said,
&ldquo;O friend, my daughter is entangled in great misfortunes; no man
can presume to marry her and enjoy her.&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I am
in hopes you will explain more fully.&rdquo; Then that strange man
related thus his story;&mdash;&ldquo;Hear, O prince! I am a chief and
grandee of this unfortunate city; my forefathers were celebrated, and
of a great family; God the Most High bestowed on me this daughter; when
she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7847" href="#xd26e7847" name=
"xd26e7847">294</a>]</span>became a woman, her beauty and gracefulness
and elegance of manners were celebrated; and over the whole country it
was said, that in such a person&rsquo;s house is a daughter, before
whose beauty even angels and fairies are abashed; how can a human
creature, therefore, be compared to her! The prince of this city heard
these praises, and became enamoured of her by report without seeing
her; he quitted food and drink, and became quite restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, the king heard of this circumstance, and called me
at night in private and mentioned to me how matters stood; he coaxed me
so with fine speeches, that at last he got my consent to an alliance
[by marriage] with him. I likewise [naturally] reflected that as a
daughter was born to me, she must be married to some one or other; then
what can be better, than to marry her to the prince? this the king also
entreats. I accepted the proposal, and took my leave. From that day the
preparations for the marriage were begun by both parties; and on an
auspicious hour, all the <i>&#7731;&#257;z&#803;&#299;s</i> and
<i>muft&#299;s</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7857src" href=
"#xd26e7857" name="xd26e7857src">12</a> the learned men and the nobles
were convened, and the marriage rites were performed; the bride was
carried away with great <i>eclat</i>, and all the ceremonies were
finished. At night, when the bridegroom wished to consummate the
nuptial rites, such a noise and uproar arose in the palace, that the
people without who mounted guard were surprised. They wished that
having opened the door of the room, they might see what was the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7873" href="#xd26e7873" name=
"xd26e7873">295</a>]</span>matter; but it was so fastened from the
inside, that they could not open it. A moment after, the noise of
lamentation became less; they then broke open the door from its hinges,
and saw the bridegroom with his head severed from his [body], and [his
limbs] still quivering; and the bride foamed at the mouth, and rolled
senseless in the dust mingled with [her husband&rsquo;s] blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On seeing this horrible sight, the senses of all present
forsook them; that such grief should succeed such felicity! The
dreadful intelligence was conveyed to the king; he flew [to the spot],
beating his head; all the officers of state were soon assembled there,
but no one&rsquo;s judgment was of any use in ascertaining the [cause
of] this [mysterious] affair; at length the king, in his distracted
state, ordered the ill-fated, luckless bride&rsquo;s head to be cut off
likewise. The moment this order was issued from the king&rsquo;s lips,
the same clamour arose; the king was alarmed, and from fear of his
life, he ran off, and ordered the bride to be turned out of the palace.
The female attendants conveyed this [unfortunate] girl to my house. The
account of this strange event soon spread over the whole kingdom, and
whoever heard it was amazed; and owing to the prince&rsquo;s murder,
the king himself and all the inhabitants of the city became bitter
enemies of my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the public mourning was over, and the fortieth day
completed, the king asked counsel of the officers of state, saying,
&lsquo;What is next to be done?&rsquo; They all said, &lsquo;Nothing
else can be done; but in order to console your majesty&rsquo;s mind,
and inspire it with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7879" href=
"#xd26e7879" name="xd26e7879">296</a>]</span>patience, to put the girl
and her father to death, and confiscate their property.&rsquo; When
this punishment of me and mine was determined on, the magistrate
received orders [to put it in execution]; he came and surrounded my
house [with guards] on all sides and sounded a trumpet at the gate, and
was about to enter in order to execute the king&rsquo;s orders. From
some hidden quarter, such showers of stones and bricks were poured on
them that the whole band could not stand against it, and covering their
faces, they were dispersed hither and thither; and these dreadful
sounds issued, which even the king himself heard in his palace;
&lsquo;What misfortune impels thee! what demon possesses thee! if thou
desirest thy welfare, molest not that fair one, or else the fate that
thy son met with by marrying her, thou shalt experience the like doom
by being her foe; if thou now molestest her, thou wilt rue its
consequences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king fell into a fever through fear, and instantly
ordered that &lsquo;No one should molest these evil-fated persons; to
say nothing to them, to hear nothing from them, but to let them remain
in their house, and that no one should injure or oppress them.&rsquo;
From that day, the magicians, conceiving this mysterious event to be
witchcraft, have used all their exorcising arts and spells to destroy
its effects; and all the inhabitants of this city read [prayers] from
the glorious <i>&#7730;ur,&#257;n</i>, and pronounced the great name of
God. It is a long while since this awful scene took place, but to this
day the mysterious secret has not been developed, nor do I know
anything about it; I once asked the girl what she had seen with her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7887" href="#xd26e7887" name=
"xd26e7887">297</a>]</span>own eyes; she replied, I know nothing more
than that when my husband wished to consummate our marriage, I saw the
roof instantly open, and a throne set with precious stones descended
through the aperture, on which was seated a handsome young man dressed
in princely robes, and many persons in attendance upon him, came into
that apartment; and were ready to put the prince to death. That young
man came up to me and said, &ldquo;Well, my love, where to will you now
escape from me?&rdquo; They had the appearance of men, but with feet
like goats; my heart palpitated, and I fainted through fear; I do not
know what afterwards happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that period we have both thus lived in this ruined
place; and from the fear of offending the king, all our friends have
forsaken us; when I go out to beg, no one gives me a
<i>&#7731;au&#7771;&#299;</i>; moreover, it is not allowed me even to
stand before their shops; this unfortunate girl has not a rag to cover
her nakedness, nor sufficient food to satisfy her hunger. From God I
only pray for this, that our deaths should ensue, or that the earth may
open out and swallow this ill-fated girl: death is better than such
existence; God has perhaps sent thee here for our good; so that thou
tookest pity on us, and gave us a piece of gold, which has enabled us
to have good food and clothes for my daughter. God be praised, and
blessed be thou; if she was not under the influence of some <i>jinn</i>
or fairy, then I would give her for thy service like a slave, and think
myself happy. This is my wretched story; do not think of her, but
abandon all thoughts on that head.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e7897" href="#xd26e7897" name="xd26e7897">298</a>]</span></p>
<p>After hearing this sad narrative, I entreated the old man to accept
me as his son-in-law, and if evil be my future doom, then let it come;
but the old man would on no account agree to my request. When the
evening came, I took my leave of him, and went to the
<i>sar&#257;&#299;</i>. <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> said, &ldquo;Well, prince,
rejoice, God has favoured you, and your labours are not thrown
away.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I have to-day used many fair speeches,
but that infidel old man will not consent; God knows if he will give
her to me or not.&rdquo; My mind was in such a state that I passed the
night in great restlessness, and wished the morning was come that I
might return [and see her]; I sometimes fancied, that if the father
should be kind and agree to my wishes, <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> would carry
her away for <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>. I then said to
myself, &ldquo;Well, let us once get possession of her; I will then get
over <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, and enjoy her.&rdquo; Again my heart was
filled with apprehensions, that even if <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> should
likewise agree to my project, the <i>jinns</i> would serve me as they
had served the prince; moreover the king of this city will never
consent, that after the murder of his son, another should enjoy [his
bride].</p>
<p>I passed the whole night without sleep, agitated by this project.
When the day appeared, I issued forth, and went to the <i>chauk</i>,
and purchased some pieces of fine cloth and lace, and fresh and dried
fruits; and carried them to the old man. He was greatly pleased, and
said, &ldquo;That to every one nothing is dearer than life, but even if
my life could be of any use to thee, I would not grieve to sacrifice
it, and give thee now my daughter; but I fear that by doing so, I might
endanger <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7927" href="#xd26e7927"
name="xd26e7927">299</a>]</span>thy life, and the stain of this
reproach would remain upon me to the day of judgment.&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;I am now in this city, helpless, it is true, and you
are my father in every respect, temporal and spiritual, but [consider]
what pains, fatigues and miseries I have undergone, and what buffetings
I have for a long while suffered to attain the object of my wishes,
before I arrived here. God has likewise made you kind towards me, since
you consent to marry her to me, and only hesitate on account of my
safety; be just for a moment, and reflect that to save our heads from
the sword of love, and screen our lives from its danger, is not
commendable in any religion; let what will happen, I have lost myself
in every way; and to possess the object of my love, I consider as my
existence. I do not care if I live or perish; moreover, despair will
finish my days without the assistance of fate, and I will stand forth
as your accuser on the day of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short, in such altercations, in hesitations between refusal and
acquiescence, a tedious month passed heavily over my head, accompanied
with future hopes and fears; I used every day to devote my services to
the old man, and every day, with flattering speeches, I entreated him
[to grant my boon]. It came to pass, that the old man fell sick; I
attended him during his illness; I used always to relate his case to
the physician, and whatever medicine he ordered, I used to get them,
and administer them to him; I used to dress with my own hand his rice
and pulse and other light diet, and gave it to him to eat. One day he
was [uncommonly] kind, and said, &ldquo;O young man, thou art very
obstinate; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7931" href="#xd26e7931"
name="xd26e7931">300</a>]</span>I have repeatedly told thee of all the
evils which will ensue if thou persistest in thy object, and have often
warned thee not to think of it. Whilst we have life, we have every
thing, but thou art determined to jump into the abyss; well, I will
to-day mention thee to my daughter; let us hear what she says.&rdquo; O
holy <i>Darweshes</i>, on hearing these enchanting words, I swelled so
with joy, that my clothes could scarce contain me; I fell at the old
man&rsquo;s feet, and exclaimed, &ldquo;You have now laid the
foundation of my [future happiness and] existence.&rdquo; I then took
my leave and returned to my abode, I passed the whole night in talking
of this circumstance with <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>; where was sleep, and
where was hunger! Early in the morning I again went and saluted the old
man; he said, &ldquo;Well, I give you my daughter&mdash;God bless you
with her&mdash;I have put you both under his protection&mdash;whilst I
have life, stay with me; when my eyes are closed, then do what you
wish; you will then be master of your own actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few days after [this conversation], the old man died; we mourned
for him and buried him. After the <i>t&#299;j&#257;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7944src" href="#xd26e7944" name=
"xd26e7944src">13</a> <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> brought this beautiful
daughter to the <i>ser&#257;&#299;</i> in a <i>dol&#299;</i>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7963src" href="#xd26e7963" name=
"xd26e7963src">14</a> and said to me, &ldquo;She belongs, [pure and
untouched], to <i>Maliki S&#257;di&#7731;</i>; beware you do not play
false, and lose the fruits of your labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied, &ldquo;O friend, what has <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> to do here? my heart will not mind me, and
how can I have patience? let what will happen, whether I live or
perish, let me now enjoy her.&rdquo; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, having
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7977" href="#xd26e7977" name=
"xd26e7977">301</a>]</span>lost all patience, replied, with anger,
&ldquo;Do not act like a boy; now, in an instant, matters will change
dreadfully; do you think <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> far off,
that you disregard his injunctions? He explained every circumstance to
you on taking leave, and warned you of the consequences; if you act
according to his directions, and convey her safe and sound to him, he
has a royal mind, and may regard the toils you have undergone with a
favourable eye, and give her to you; how different will the case be
then! you will preserve his unbounded friendship, and gain the sincere
affection [of your mistress].&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, [from the force of his] threats and admonitions, I remained
silent; I bought two camels, and mounting on
<i>kaj&#257;was</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e7987src" href=
"#xd26e7987" name="xd26e7987src">15</a> we set out for the country of
<i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>. We pursued our journey, and at
last reached a plain, where loud noises were heard. <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>
exclaimed, &ldquo;God be praised, our labours have turned out well, for
lo! the army of <i>jinns</i> is here arrived.&rdquo; He met them at
last, and asked them where they intended to go. They replied,
&ldquo;The king has sent us forward for the purpose of receiving you,
and we are now under your orders; if you command us, we will convey you
in a moment to the presence [of the king].&rdquo; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>,
turning to me, said, &ldquo;See how, after all our toils and dangers,
God has favoured us before the face of the king; what is the need of
haste now? if some misconduct should occur, which God forbid, then the
fruits of our labours would be lost, and we should fall under the
king&rsquo;s displeasure.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8003" href="#xd26e8003" name="xd26e8003">302</a>]</span>They all
answered, &ldquo;You are the sole master in this; proceed as you
please.&rdquo; Although we were comfortable in every way, yet we made
it our business to march day and night.</p>
<p>When we approached [the place where the king was], I, seeing
<i>Mub&#257;rak</i> asleep, fell at that beautiful woman&rsquo;s feet,
and bewailing to her the restless state of my heart, and my helpless
condition, owing to the threats of <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>, and that from the day I had seen her
picture, I had forsworn sleep and food and repose; and now that God had
shewn to me this day, I still remained an utter stranger to her. She
replied, &ldquo;My heart is also inclined towards you, for what toils
and dangers have you undergone for my sake, and with what labour and
difficulty have you brought me away; remember God, and do not forget
me; let us see what may be revealed from behind the curtain of
mystery.&rdquo; On saying this, she wept so loud that she was nearly
suffocated. Such was my state, and such was hers! In the meantime,
<i>Mub&#257;rak&rsquo;s</i> slumbers were broken, and seeing us both in
tears, he was greatly affected, and said, &ldquo;Be comforted; I have
an ointment which I will rub over the body of this fair one; from the
smell of it the heart of <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> will be
disgusted, and he will perhaps abandon her to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this plan of <i>Mub&#257;rak&rsquo;s</i>, my heart was
greatly revived; and, embracing him fondly, I said, &ldquo;O friend,
you are now in the place of a father to me; owing to you my life was
saved, now also act so that I may still live on, otherwise I must
perish in this grief.&rdquo; He gave me every friendly assurance. When
the day appeared, we heard the noise of the <i>jinns</i>, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8027" href="#xd26e8027" name=
"xd26e8027">303</a>]</span>saw that many personal attendants of
<i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> were arrived, and had brought two
rich <i>k&#863;hil&rsquo;ats</i> for us, and a covered litter with a
network of pearls accompanied them. <i>Mub&#257;rak</i> rubbed the
ointment over my beloved&rsquo;s body; and having caused her to be
richly dressed, he conveyed her to <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>. On beholding her, the king rewarded me
greatly, and having honoured and dignified me, he made me sit down
[near himself], and said, &ldquo;I will behave to thee such as no one
has as yet done to any one; the kingdom of thy father awaits thee,
besides which thou art in the place of a son to me.&rdquo; He was
talking to me in this gracious manner, when the beautiful woman
appeared before him, and suddenly at the smell of that ointment, his
brain became confused, and his mind distracted; he could not endure
that smell; having got up, he went out and called <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>
and me; he addressed himself to <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, and said,
&ldquo;Well, sir, you have truly performed the injunctions [I
gave].</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had warned you, that if you deceived me, you would incur my
displeasure; what smell is this? now see how I will treat you.&rdquo;
He was very angry; <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, from fear, opened his trowsers,
and showed his condition,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8053src" href=
"#xd26e8053" name="xd26e8053src">16</a> and said, &ldquo;Mighty king,
when I undertook this business, according to your commands, I then cut
off my privities, and put them in a box, sealed it, and delivered it
over in charge to your treasurer, and putting some ointment of Solomon
on the mutilated parts, I set out on the errand.&rdquo; On hearing this
reply from <i>Mub&#257;rak</i>, the king of the <i>jinns</i> looked
sternly at me, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8062" href=
"#xd26e8062" name="xd26e8062">304</a>]</span>and said, &ldquo;Then,
this is thy doing;&rdquo; and getting into a rage, he began to abuse
me. I immediately perceived from his words that he would put me to
death. When I felt convinced of this from his looks, despairing of
life, I became desperate, and snatching the dagger from
<i>Mub&#257;rak&rsquo;s</i> waist, I plunged it into the king&rsquo;s
belly; on receiving the stab, he bent down and staggered; I wondered,
for I thought he must assuredly have perished; I then perceived that
the wound was not so effective as I imagined, and could not account for
it; I was staring [with surprise] when he rolled on the ground, and
assuming the appearance of a tennis ball, he flew up to the sky. He
ascended so high, that at last he disappeared; a moment after, flashing
like lightning, and vociferating some meaningless words in his rage, he
descended, and gave me such a kick, that I swooned away, and fell flat
on my back, and became as one lifeless. God knows how long I remained
ere I came to my senses; but when I opened my eyes I saw that I was
lying in such a wilderness, where, except thorns and briars, nothing
else was to be seen; at that moment my understanding was of no avail to
fix on what I should do, or where I should go. In this state of
despondence, I gave a sigh, and followed the first path that offered;
if I met any one any where, I inquired after the name of <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>; he, thinking me mad, answered that he had
not even heard his name.</p>
<p>One day, having ascended a mountain, I likewise determined to throw
myself [off its summit], and end my existence; just as I was ready to
jump off, the same veiled horseman, the possessor of
<i>Z&#803;&#363;-l-fa&#7731;&#257;r</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8077src" href="#xd26e8077" name="xd26e8077src">17</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8085" href="#xd26e8085" name=
"xd26e8085">305</a>]</span>appeared and said, &ldquo;Why do you throw
away your life; man is exposed to every pain and misery; your unhappy
days are now over, and your propitious ones are coming; go quickly to
<i>R&#363;m</i>&mdash;three afflicted persons like thee are gone there
before thee&mdash;meet them, and see the king of that country; the
wishes of all five will be fulfilled in the same place.&rdquo; This is
my story which I have just related; at last, from the happy tidings of
our difficulty-solving guardian,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8090src"
href="#xd26e8090" name="xd26e8090src">18</a> I am come into the
presence of your worships, and have also been kindly received by the
king, who is the shadow of Omnipotence; we ought all now to be
comforted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This conversation was passing between the king <i>&#256;z&#257;d
Bak&#863;ht</i> and the four <i>Darweshes</i>, when a eunuch came
running from the royal seraglio and with respectful salutation, wished
his majesty joy, and added, &ldquo;This moment a prince is born, before
whose refulgent beauty the sun and moon are abashed.&rdquo; The king
was surprised, and asked, &ldquo;No one was pregnant<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8104src" href="#xd26e8104" name="xd26e8104src">19</a> in
appearance; who has brought forth a son?<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8113" title="Source: &rsquo;">&rdquo;</span> The eunuch replied,
&ldquo;<i>M&#257;hr&#363;</i>, the female slave, who for some time hath
lain under your majesty&rsquo;s displeasure, and lived like an outcast
in a corner [of the seraglio], and no one from fear ever went near her
or asked after her state; on her the grace of God hath been such, that
she hath borne a son like the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king was so rejoiced, that he nearly expired from excessive joy;
the four <i>Darweshes</i> also blessed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8124" href="#xd26e8124" name="xd26e8124">306</a>]</span>him, and
said, &ldquo;May thy house be ever happy, and may thy son prosper; and
may he grow up under thy shadow.&rdquo; The king replied, &ldquo;This
is owing to your propitious arrival, for otherwise I had no idea of
such an event; if you give me leave, I will go and see him.&rdquo; The
<i>Darweshes</i> answered, &ldquo;In the name of God, go.&rdquo; The
king went to the seraglio, and took the young prince in his lap, and
thanked God; his mind became easy; pressing the infant to his bosom, he
brought it and laid it at the <i>Darweshes&rsquo;</i> feet; they
blessed it, and exorcised all evil spirits from approaching it. The
king commanded the preparations of a festival to be made [on the happy
occasion], and the royal music struck up, and the door of the treasury
was opened; with princely donations he made the poor<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8132src" href="#xd26e8132" name="xd26e8132src">20</a> rich; on
all the officers of state he bestowed a two-fold increase of lands and
higher titles, and to the army he gave five years&rsquo; pay as a
present; to the learned and holy he gave pensions and lands; and the
wallets of the beggars were filled with pieces of gold and silver; and
the <i>ryots</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8144src" href="#xd26e8144"
name="xd26e8144src">21</a> were excused from paying any revenue for
three years, and that whatever they cultivated during this period, they
should keep for themselves.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole city, in the houses of the high and the low,
wherever one looked, there were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8157" href="#xd26e8157" name="xd26e8157">307</a>]</span>merry
dances; in their joy, every one, small and great, felt himself a
prince. In the midst of these rejoicings, the sounds of lamentation and
weeping issued suddenly from the seraglio; the female servants, of all
descriptions, and the eunuchs, ran out, scattering dust upon their
heads, and said to the king, &ldquo;When we had washed and bathed the
prince, and delivered him to the bosom of the nurse, a cloud descended
from the sky and enveloped the nurse; a moment after, we saw the nurse
prostrate and senseless, and the little prince gone; what a dreadful
calamity has occurred!&rdquo; The king was thunderstruck on hearing
this wonderful occurrence; and the whole country mourned [for the sad
event]; for two days no one dressed any victuals, but fed on their
grief, and drank their own blood, for the prince&rsquo;s loss.</p>
<p>In short, they began to despair of their lives, living in this
manner; on the third day the same cloud appeared, and a cradle studded
with jewels, and with a covering of pearls, descended from it into the
area of the seraglio; the cloud then disappeared, and the servants
found the little prince in the cradle sucking his thumb; the royal
mother immediately invoking blessings upon him, took him up in her
arms, and pressed him fondly to her bosom; she saw that he was dressed
in a jacket of fine muslin embroidered with pearls, and had a
child&rsquo;s bib of brocade, and many ornaments set with jewels on his
hands and feet, and a necklace with nine gems on his neck, and there
was a child&rsquo;s rattle with golden balls placed by his side.
Through joy all [the female attendants] were transported; and they
began to offer up prayers, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8161"
href="#xd26e8161" name="xd26e8161">308</a>]</span>saying, &ldquo;May
all thy mother&rsquo;s wishes be gratified, and mayest thou attain a
period of mature old age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king ordered a new grand palace to be built and furnished with
carpets, and kept the four <i>Darweshes</i> in it; when he was
disengaged from the affairs of state, he used to go there, sit with
them, and to provide everything for them and wait on them; but on the
first Thursday night of every month the same cloud descended, and took
away the prince, and after keeping him two days, it used to bring him
back, with such rich toys and rarities of every country, and of every
description, in his cradle, that on beholding them, the minds of the
spectators were confounded with astonishment. In this manner, the
prince reached in safety his seventh year; on the birthday the king
<i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> said to the <i>Darweshes</i>,
&ldquo;O holy men, I cannot conceive who carries the prince away and
brings him back; it is very wonderful; let us see what will be the end
of it.&rdquo; The <i>Darweshes</i> said, &ldquo;Do one thing; write a
friendly note to this purport, and put it into the prince&rsquo;s
cradle, viz.:&mdash;&rsquo;Having seen your friendship and kindness [to
my son], my heart wishes most anxiously to meet you, and if by way of
amity you favour me with your tidings, my heart will be highly
gratified, and my wonder will cease.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; The king,
according to the <i>Darweshes&rsquo;</i> advice, wrote a note to this
purport on paper sprinkled with gold, and put it in the golden
cradle.</p>
<p>The prince, according to custom, disappeared; and in the evening
<i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> was sitting with the <i>Darweshes</i>
and conversing with them, when a folded paper fell near the king; he
opened it and read it, and found <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8188" href="#xd26e8188" name="xd26e8188">309</a>]</span>that it
was an answer to his note; these two lines were written in it:
&ldquo;Conceive me likewise anxious to see you; a throne goes for you;
it is best that you should come now, that we may meet; all the
preparations of enjoyment are ready; your majesty&rsquo;s place alone
is empty.&rdquo; The king <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> took the
<i>Darweshes</i> with him, and ascended the celestial throne; it was
like the throne of Solomon, and mounted into the air; proceeding on, it
descended in a place where grand edifices and sumptuous preparations
appeared; but it could not be perceived if any one was there or not. In
the meantime some one rubbed the eyes of all five with the <i>surma</i>
of <i>Sulaiman</i>; two drops of tears fell from the eyes of each, and
they saw an assembly of the fairies, who were waiting to receive them,
dressed in rich habits of various colours, with vials of rose-water in
their hands. <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> advanced amidst two rows
consisting of thousands of fairy-born creatures, standing in respectful
order, and in the centre was placed an elevated throne inlaid with
emeralds, on which was seated leaning on pillows, with an air of great
dignity, <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>, the son of
<i>Sh&#257;h-ruk&#863;h;</i> a beautiful little girl of the fairy race
was seated before him, and was playing with the young prince
<i>Bak&#863;htiy&#257;r</i>. Chairs and seats were arranged in rows on
both sides of the throne, on which the nobles of the fairy race were
seated. <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> stood up on seeing the king
<i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> and descended from his throne and
embraced him, and taking him by the hand, he seated him on the throne
by the side of himself, and they began to converse together with much
cordiality; the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8222" href=
"#xd26e8222" name="xd26e8222">310</a>]</span>whole day passed in
feasting and hilarity, and music and dancing. The second day, when the
two kings met, <i>Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> asked <i>&#256;z&#257;d
Bak&#863;ht</i> the reason for bringing the <i>Darweshes</i> with him.
<i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> related fully their adventures as he
had previously learned, and interceded for them, and asked [the
king&rsquo;s] assistance, saying, &ldquo;These have undergone many
hardships, and suffered great misfortunes; and if now, through your
favour, they attain their wishes, it will be an act of great merit, and
I also will be grateful for it through life; by your kind assistance
they will all reach the summit of their desires.&rdquo; <i>Malik
Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>, after hearing [these adventures, replied,
&ldquo;Most willingly; I will not fail to obey your commands.&rdquo;
Saying this, he looked sternly at the <i>divs</i> and fairies [who were
present], and he wrote letters to the great <i>jinns</i>, who were
chiefs in different places, and ordered them, that on receiving his
commands, they must repair speedily to the presence, and if any one
should delay in coming, he should be punished, and brought as captive;
and that whoever possessed any persons of the human species, male or
female, he must bring them along with him; that if [a <i>jinn</i>]
having concealed any one, should detain the same, and it be known
hereafter, the concealer and his wife and family shall be exterminated,
and no vestige of them will remain.</p>
<p>Receiving these written orders, the <i>divs</i> were dispatched in
all directions. A great warmth of friendship arose between the two
kings, and they passed their time in amicable conversation, amidst
which <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>, turning round to the
<i>Darweshes</i>, said, &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8260" href="#xd26e8260" name="xd26e8260">311</a>]</span>had a
great wish to have children, and had resolved, if God gave me a son or
a daughter, to marry it to the offspring of some king of the human
race. After this resolve, I learned that my wife was pregnant; at last,
after counting with anxiety each day and hour, the full period arrived,
and this girl was born. According to my determination, I ordered the
<i>jinns</i> to search the four corners of the world, and that whatever
king had a prince born to him, to bring the child quickly to me with
care; agreeably to my orders, the <i>jinns</i> flew instantly to the
four corners of the earth, and after some delay, brought this young
prince to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thanked God, and took the child in my lap, and loved it
dearer than my own daughter; I could not bring myself to separate him
from my sight for a moment, but used to send him back for this reason,
that if his parents did not see him, they would be greatly afflicted.
For this reason I sent for him once every month, and after keeping him
with me a few days, I sent him back. If it please God the Most High,
now that we have met, I will marry them to each other; all are liable
to death, then let us, whilst we are alive, see their marriage
performed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>, on hearing this proposal
of <i>Sh&#257;h B&#257;l&rsquo;s</i>, and seeing his amiable qualities,
was greatly pleased and said, &ldquo;At first the prince&rsquo;s
disappearance and re-appearance raised very strange aprehensions in my
breast, but I am now, from your conversation, easy in my mind, and
perfectly satisfied; this son is now yours; do with him whatever you
please.&rdquo; In short, the intercourse between the two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8282" href="#xd26e8282" name=
"xd26e8282">312</a>]</span>kings was like that of sugar and milk, and
they fully enjoyed themselves. In the space of less than ten days,
mighty kings of the race of the <i>jinns</i>, from the rose garden of
<i>Iram</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8291src" href="#xd26e8291"
name="xd26e8291src">22</a> and from mountains and islands, (to call
whom the fairies had been dispatched) all arrived at the court [of
<i>Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>]. In the first place, <i>Maliki
&#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i> was ordered to produce the human creature he
had in his possession; he was much vexed at it, and sad, but having no
remedy, he produced the rosy-cheeked fair one [the blind man&rsquo;s
daughter]. Next, he demanded of the king of
<i>&rsquo;Umm&#257;n</i><a class="noteref" id="xd26e8302src" href=
"#xd26e8302" name="xd26e8302src">23</a> the daughter of one of the
<i>jinns</i> for whom the prince of <i>N&#299;mroz</i>, the bull rider,
went mad; he likewise made many excuses, but produced her at last. When
the daughter of the king of the Franks and <i>Bihz&#257;d
K&#863;h&#257;n</i> were demanded, all present denied having any
knowledge of them, and swore by Solomon [to that effect].</p>
<p>At last, when the king of the sea of <i>&#7730;ulzum</i> was asked
if he knew anything of them, he hung down his head, and remained
silent. <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> had a deference for him, and
entreated him to give them up, and gave him hopes of future favour and
even threatened him. Then he also joined his hands together, and said,
&ldquo;Please your majesty, the particulars of that circumstance are as
follows:&mdash;When the king <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8334"
href="#xd26e8334" name="xd26e8334">313</a>]</span>[of Persia] came to
the river <i>&#7730;ulzum</i> to meet his son, and the prince from
eagerness plunged his horse into the flood, it chanced that I had gone
out that day to roam about and to hunt. I passed by the place, and the
cavalcade stopped to behold the scene. When the princess&rsquo;s mare
carried her also into the stream, my looks met hers, and I was
enchanted, and gave instant orders to the fairy race to bring her to
me, together with the mare. <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i> plunged
in also after her on horseback; I admired his bravery and gallantry,
and had him seized likewise; I took him with me, and returned home; so
they are both safe, and with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, he sent for them both before <i>Malik Sh&#257;h
B&#257;l</i>. Great search had been made for the daughter of the king
of Syria, and strict inquiries were put to all present, but no one
acknowledged having her, or knowing anything about her. <i>Malik
Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> then asked if any king or chief was absent, and
if all were arrived; the <i>jinns</i> answered, &ldquo;Mighty sire, all
are present except one named <i>Musalsal J&#257;d&#363;</i>, who has
erected a fort on the mountain <i>&#7730;&#257;f</i> by the means of
magic; he, from haughtiness, is not come, and we, your majesty&rsquo;s
slaves, are not able to bring him by force; the place is strong, and he
himself also is a great devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this, <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> was very angry, and
an army of <i>jinns, &rsquo;afr&#299;ts</i> and fairies were sent with
orders, that if he came of his own accord, and brought the princess
with him, well and good, but otherwise subdue him, and bring him tied
by the neck and heels, and raze his fort to the ground, and drive the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8368" href="#xd26e8368" name=
"xd26e8368">314</a>]</span>plough, drawn by an ass, over it.
Immediately, on the orders being given, such numbers of troops flew to
the place, that in a day or two the rebellious haughty chief was
brought in irons to the presence. <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>
repeatedly asked about the princess, but the haughty rebel gave no
reply. The king at length got angry, and ordered him to be cut to
pieces, and his skin stretched and filled with chaff;<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8373src" href="#xd26e8373" name="xd26e8373src">24</a> a body
of fairies were ordered to go to the mountain of <i>&#7730;&#257;f</i>,
and search for the princess; they went and found her, and brought her
to <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>. All these prisoners and the four
<i>Darweshes</i>, seeing the strict orders and justice of the king
<i>Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>, were greatly rejoiced, and admired him
highly; the king <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i> was also much
pleased. <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> then ordered the men to the
palace, and the women to the royal seraglio; the city was ordered to be
illuminated, and the preparations for the marriages to be quickly
completed; [all was instantly made ready], as if the order alone was
wanted to be given.</p>
<p>One day, a happy hour being fixed upon, the prince
<i>Bak&#863;htiy&#257;r</i> was married to the princess <i>Roshan
Ak&#863;htar</i>; and the young merchant of <i>Yaman</i><a class=

prince of <i>Nimroz</i> was married to the <i>jinn&rsquo;s</i>
daughter; and the prince of China<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8453src"
href="#xd26e8453" name="xd26e8453src">28</a> was married to the
daughter of the old blind man of <i>Hind&#363;st&#257;n</i>; she who
had been in the possession of <i>Maliki &#7778;&#257;di&#7731;</i>.
Through the favour of <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i>, every hopeless
person gained his desires, and obtained his wishes; afterwards, they
all enjoyed themselves for forty days, and passed their time, night and
day, in pleasures and festivity.</p>
<p>At last, <i>Malik Sh&#257;h B&#257;l</i> gave to each prince rich
and rare presents, and dismissed them to their different countries. All
were pleased and satisfied, and set out and reached their homes in
safety, and began their reigns; but <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i>,
and the merchant&rsquo;s son of <i>Yaman</i>, of their own accord,
remained with the king <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>, and in the
end the young merchant of <i>Yaman</i> was made head steward to his
majesty, and <i>Bihz&#257;d K&#863;h&#257;n</i> generalissimo of the
army of the fortunate prince <i>Bak&#863;htiy&#257;r</i>; whilst they
lived, they enjoyed every felicity. O God! as these four
<i>Darweshes</i> and the king <i>&#256;z&#257;d Bak&#863;ht</i>
attained their wishes, in like manner grant to all hopeless beings the
wishes of their hearts, through thy power and goodness, and by the
medium of the five pure bodies,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8498src"

<p>When this book was finished, through the favour of God, I took it
into my mind to give it such a name, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e8531" href="#xd26e8531" name="xd26e8531">316</a>]</span>that the
date should be thereby found out.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8533src"
href="#xd26e8533" name="xd26e8533src">31</a> When I made the
calculation, I found that I had begun to compose this work in the end
of the year of the <i>Hijra</i> 1215, and owing to want of leisure, it
was not finished until the beginning of the year 1217; I was reflecting
on this circumstance, when it occurred to me that the words
<i>B&#257;g&#863;h O Bah&#257;r</i> formed a proper title, as it
answered to the date of the year when the work was finished; so I gave
it this name. Whoever shall read it, he will stroll as it were through
a garden; moreover, the garden is exposed to the blasts of winter, but
this book is not; it will ever be in verdure.</p>
<p>When this <i>B&#257;g&#863;h O Bah&#257;r</i> was finished, the year
was 1217; do you now stroll through it night and day, as its name and
date is <i>B&#257;g&#863;h O Bah&#257;r</i>; the blasts of winter can
do it no injury; for this <i>Bah&#257;r</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e8561src" href="#xd26e8561" name="xd26e8561src">32</a> is ever
green and fresh; it hath been nourished with the blood of my heart, and
its (the heart&rsquo;s) pieces are its leaves and fruits;&mdash;all
will forget me after death;&mdash;but this book will remain as a
<i>souvenir</i>; whoever reads it, let him remember me. This is my
agreement with the readers; if there is an error, excuse it; for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8579" href="#xd26e8579" name=
"xd26e8579">317</a>]</span>amidst flowers lie concealed the thorns; man
is liable to faults and errors, and he will fail, let him be ever so
careful. I have no other wish except this, and it is my earnest prayer.
O my Creator, that I may ever remain in remembrance of Thee, and thus
pass my nights and days! That I may not be questioned with severity on
the night of death, and the day of reckoning! O God, in both worlds
shower thy favours on me, through the mediation of the great
prophet!</p>

on the gates of mosques, the dates of demise and erection can be
ascertained. We had the same barbarous custom in Europe about the

spring, but an agreeable spring. The Persians are as fond of these
<i>double entendres</i> as any other people; their poetry is strewed
with them, and so is their prose. It is not, however, to be considered

<p class="first">It must be allowed, that the author has displayed
great adroitness in the &ldquo;denouement&rdquo; of his tale. In the
course of a few pages all the principal characters, male and female,
are suddenly produced, safe and unscathed, before the reader. To be
sure, this is done by the aid of a little &ldquo;diablerie,&rdquo; but
then it is done very neatly,&mdash;much more so than in some of the
clumsy fictions of the late Ettrick Shepherd, to say nothing of the
edifying legends about the Romish saints which the good people of
southern Europe are taught to swallow as gospel. Finally, be it
remembered, that Oriental story-tellers have never subscribed to
Horace&rsquo;s precept,&mdash;</p>
